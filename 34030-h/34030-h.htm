<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<hr class="c05" />

<p>Specialization in machine-tool manufacture has been developed
to such a degree that there is need also for treatises which
specialize on different classes of tools and their application in
modern practice. This book deals exclusively with the use of
various types of turning and boring machines and their attachments,
and is believed to be unusually complete. In addition
to standard practice, it describes many special operations
seldom or never presented in text-books. Very little space is
given to mere descriptions of different types of machine tools, the
principal purpose being to explain the use of the machine and the
practical problems connected with its operation, rather than
the constructional details. No attempt has been made to
describe every machine or tool which might properly be included,
but rather to deal with the more important and useful
operations, especially those which illustrate general principles.</p>

<p>Readers of mechanical literature are familiar with <span class="smcap">Machinery's</span>
25-cent Reference Books, of which one hundred and
twenty-five different titles have been published during the past
six years. Many subjects, however, cannot be adequately
covered in all their phases in books of this size, and in response
to a demand for more comprehensive and detailed treatments
on the more important mechanical subjects, it has been deemed
advisable to bring out a number of larger volumes, of which this
is one. This work includes much of the material published in
<span class="smcap">Machinery's</span> Reference Books Nos. 91, 92 and 95, together
with a great amount of additional information on modern boring
and turning methods.</p>

<p>It is a pleasure to acknowledge our indebtedness to the manufacturers
who generously supplied illustrations and data, including
many interesting operations from actual practice.
Much valuable information was also obtained from <span class="smcap">Machinery</span>.</p>

<h3>THE ENGINE LATHE&mdash;TURNING AND BORING OPERATIONS</h3>
<hr class="c05" />

<a name="Secnum_1_1" id="Secnum_1_1"></a><p>The standard &#8220;engine&#8221; lathe, which is the type commonly
used by machinists for doing general work, is one of the most
important tools in a machine shop, because it is adapted to a
great variety of operations, such as turning all sorts of cylindrical
and taper parts, boring holes, cutting threads, etc. The

a typical design, and while some of the parts are arranged

<p class="caption750">Fig. 1. Bradford Belt-driven Lathe&mdash;View of Front or Operating Side</p></div>

<p>The principal parts are the bed <i>B</i>, the headstock <i>H</i>, the tailstock
<i>T</i>, and the carriage <i>C</i>. The headstock contains a spindle
which is rotated by a belt that passes over the cone-pulley <i>P</i>,
and this spindle rotates the work, which is usually held between
pointed or conical centers <i>h</i> and <i>h<sub>1</sub></i> in the headstock and
tailstock, or in a chuck screwed onto the spindle instead of the
faceplate <i>F</i>. The carriage <i>C</i> can be moved lengthwise along
the bed by turning handle <i>d</i>, and it can also be moved by power,
the movement being transmitted from the headstock spindle
either through gears <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and lead-screw <i>S</i>, or by a belt operating
on pulleys <i>p</i> and <i>p<sub>1</sub></i>, which drive the feed-rod <i>R</i>. The
lead-screw <i>S</i> is used when cutting threads, and the feed-rod <i>R</i>
for ordinary turning operations; in this way the wear on the
lead-screw is reduced and its accuracy is preserved.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2" id="Pg_2">[2]</a></span>

<p>On the carriage, there is a cross-slide <i>D</i> which can be moved
at right angles to the lathe bed by handle <i>e</i>, and on <i>D</i> there is
an upper or compound slide <i>E</i> which can be swiveled to different
positions. The tool <i>t</i>, that does the turning, is clamped to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_3" id="Pg_3">[3]</a></span>
upper slide, as shown, and it can be moved with relation to the
work by the movement of the carriage <i>C</i> along the bed, or by
moving slide <i>D</i> crosswise. The lengthwise movement is used to
feed the tool along the work when turning, boring or cutting a
screw, and the crosswise movement for facing the ends of shafts,
etc., or for radial turning. When the tool is to be fed at an
angle, other than at right angles to the bed, slide <i>E</i>, which can
be set to the required angle, is used. The lengthwise and crosswise
feeding movements can be effected by power, the lengthwise
feed being engaged by tightening knob <i>k</i>, and the cross-feed by
tightening knob <i>l</i>. The direction of either of these movements
can also be reversed by shifting lever <i>r</i>. Ordinarily the carriage
and slide are adjusted by hand to bring the tool into the
proper position for turning to the required diameter, and then
the power feed (operating in the desired direction) is engaged.
The tailstock <i>T</i> can be clamped in different positions along the
bed, to suit the length of the work, and its center <i>h<sub>1</sub></i> can be
moved in or out for a short distance, when adjusting it to the
work, by turning handle <i>n</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>As some metals are much harder than others, and as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_4" id="Pg_4">[4]</a></span>
diameters of parts to be turned also vary considerably, speed
changes are necessary, because if the speed is excessive, the
turning tool will become dull in too short a time. These speed
changes (with a belt-driven lathe) are obtained by placing the
driving belt on different steps of cone-pulley <i>P</i>, and also by the
use of back-gears. The cone-pulley can be connected directly
with the spindle or be disengaged from it by means of bolt <i>m</i>.
When the pulley and spindle are connected, five speeds (with
this particular lathe) are obtained by simply shifting the driving
belt to different steps of the cone. When a slower speed is
required than can be obtained with the belt on the largest step
of the cone, the latter is disconnected from the spindle, and the
back-gears <i>G</i> and <i>G<sub>1</sub></i> (shown in the plan view <a href="#Fig_1_2">Fig. 2</a>) are moved
forward into mesh by turning handle <i>O</i>; the drive is then from
cone-pulley <i>P</i> and gear <i>L</i> to gear <i>G</i>, and from gear <i>G<sub>1</sub></i> to the
large gear <i>J</i> on the spindle. When driving through the back-gears,
five more speed changes are obtained by shifting the
position of the driving belt, as before. The fastest speed with
the back-gears in mesh is somewhat slower than the slowest
speed when driving direct or with the back-gears out of mesh;
hence, with this particular lathe, a series of ten gradually increasing
speeds is obtained. Changes of feed for the turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_5" id="Pg_5">[5]</a></span>
tool are also required, and these are obtained by shifting the
belt operating on pulleys <i>p</i> and <i>p<sub>1</sub></i> to different-sized steps. On
some lathes these feed changes are obtained through gears
which can be shifted to give different ratios. Many lathes also
have gears in the headstock for changing the speeds.</p>

<p>Front and rear views of the carriage apron, which contains
the feeding mechanism, are shown in <a href="#Fig_1_3">Figs. 3</a> and <a href="#Fig_1_4">4</a>, to indicate
how the feeds are engaged and reversed. The feed-rod <i>R</i>
(<a href="#Fig_1_1">Fig. 1</a>) drives the small bevel gears <i>A</i> and <i>A<sub>1</sub></i> (<a href="#Fig_1_3">Figs. 3</a>
and <a href="#Fig_1_4">4</a>), which are mounted on a slide <i>S</i> that can be moved by lever <i>r</i>
to bring either bevel gear into mesh with gear <i>B</i>. Gear <i>B</i> is
attached to pinion <i>b</i> (see <a href="#Fig_1_3">Fig. 3</a>) meshing with gear <i>C</i>, which,
when knob <i>k</i> (<a href="#Fig_1_1">Fig. 1</a>) is tightened, is locked by a friction clutch
to pinion <i>c</i>. The latter pinion drives gear <i>D</i> which rotates
shaft <i>E</i>. A pinion cut on the end of shaft <i>E</i> engages rack <i>K</i>
(<a href="#Fig_1_1">Fig. 1</a>) attached to the bed, so that the rotation of <i>E</i> (which is
controlled by knob <i>k</i>) moves the carriage along the bed. To
reverse the direction of the movement, it is only necessary to
throw gear <i>A</i> into mesh and gear <i>A<sub>1</sub></i> out, or <i>vice versa</i>, by operating
lever <i>r</i>. When the carriage is traversed by hand, shaft
<i>E</i> and gear <i>D</i> are rotated by pinion <i>d<sub>1</sub></i> connected with handle <i>d</i>
(<a href="#Fig_1_1">Fig. 1</a>).</p>

<p>The drive for the cross-feed is from gear <i>C</i> to gear <i>F</i> which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_6" id="Pg_6">[6]</a></span>
can be engaged through a friction clutch (operated by knob <i>l</i>,
<a href="#Fig_1_1">Fig. 1</a>) with gear <i>G</i> meshing with a pinion <i>H</i>. The latter rotates
the cross-feed screw, which passes through a nut attached to
slide <i>D</i> (<a href="#Fig_1_1">Fig. 1</a>), thus moving the latter at right angles to the
ways of the bed. The cross-feed is also reversed by means of
lever <i>r</i>. As previously explained, lead-screw <i>S</i> is only used for
feeding the carriage when cutting threads. The carriage is engaged
with this screw by means of two half-nuts <i>N</i> (<a href="#Fig_1_4">Fig. 4</a>)
that are free to slide vertically and are closed around the screw
by operating lever <i>u</i>. These half-nuts can only be closed when
lever <i>r</i> is in a central or neutral position, so that the screw feed
and the regular turning feed cannot be engaged at the same
time. As previously mentioned, lead-screw <i>S</i>, <a href="#Fig_1_1">Fig. 1</a>, is rotated
from the lathe spindle, through gears <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, called change
gears. An assortment of these gears, of various sizes, is provided
with the lathe, for cutting screws of different pitch. The
gears to use for any pitch within the range of the lathe are
given on the plate <i>I</i>.</p>

<a name="Secnum_1_2" id="Secnum_1_2"></a><p><b>Example of Cylindrical Turning.</b>&mdash;Having now considered
the principal features of what might be called a standard lathe,
the method of using it in the production of machine parts will
be explained. To begin with a simple example of work, suppose
a steel shaft is to be turned to a diameter of 2<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">4</sub> inches and a
length of 14<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub> inches, these being the finished dimensions. We
will assume that the rough stock is cut off to a length of 14<sup class="enum">5</sup>/<sub class="denom">8</sub>
inches and has a diameter of 2<sup class="enum">5</sup>/<sub class="denom">8</sub> inches. The first step in this
operation is to form conically shaped center-holes in each end
of the piece as indicated at <i>c</i> in <a href="#Fig_1_5">Fig. 5</a>. As all work of this
kind is held, while being turned, between the centers <i>h</i> and <i>h<sub>1</sub></i>,
holes corresponding in shape to these centers are necessary to
keep the work in place. There are several methods of forming
these center-holes, as explained later.</p>

<p>After the work is centered, a dog <i>A</i> is clamped to one end by
tightening screw <i>s</i>; it is then placed between the centers of the
lathe. The dog has a projecting end or &#8220;tail,&#8221; as it is commonly
called, which enters a slot in the faceplate <i>F</i> and thereby drives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_7" id="Pg_7">[7]</a></span>
or rotates the work, when power is applied to the lathe spindle
onto which the faceplate is screwed. The tailstock center <i>h<sub>1</sub></i>,
after being oiled, should be set up just tight enough to eliminate
all play, without interfering with a free rotary movement of the
work. This is done by turning handle <i>n</i>, and when the center
is properly adjusted, the tailstock spindle containing the center
is locked by tightening handle <i>p</i>. (Ordinary machine oil is
commonly used for lubricating lathe centers, but a lubricant
having more &#8220;body&#8221; should be used, especially when turning
heavy parts. The following mixtures are recommended: 1. Dry
or powdered red lead mixed with a good grade of mineral oil to
the consistency of cream. 2. White lead mixed with sperm oil
with enough graphite added to give the mixture a dark lead
color.)</p>

</div>

<a name="Secnum_1_3" id="Secnum_1_3"></a><p><b>Facing the Ends Square with a Side-tool.</b>&mdash;Everything is
now ready for the turning operation. The ends of the piece
should be faced square before turning the body to size, and the
tool for this squaring operation is shown in <a href="#Fig_1_6">Fig. 6</a>; this is known
as a side-tool. It has a cutting edge <i>e</i> which shaves off the
metal as indicated in the end view by the dotted lines. The
side <i>f</i> is ground to an angle so that when the tool is moved in
the direction shown by the arrow, the cutting edge will come in
contact with the part to be turned; in other words, side <i>f</i> is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_8" id="Pg_8">[8]</a></span>
ground so as to provide clearance for the cutting edge. In addition,
the top surface against which the chip bears, is beveled
to give the tool keenness so that it will cut easily. As the principles
of tool grinding are treated separately in <a href="#Chapnum_2">Chapter II</a> we
shall for the present consider the tool's use rather than its form.</p>

<a name="Fig_1_7" id="Fig_1_7"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><div class="illobox450"><img src="images/017sm.png" alt="Facing End with Side-tool and Turning Work Cylindrical" /></div>
<p class="caption750">Fig. 7. Facing End with Side-tool and Turning Work Cylindrical</p>
</div>

<p>For facing the end, the side tool is clamped in the toolpost by
tightening the screw <i>u</i>, <a href="#Fig_1_5">Fig. 5</a>, and it should be set with the
cutting edge slightly inclined from a right-angled position, the
point being in advance so that it will first come into contact
with the work. The cutting edge should also be about the same
height as the center of the work. When the tool is set, the
lathe (if belt-driven) is started by shifting an overhead belt and
the tool is then moved in until the point is in the position shown
at <i>A</i>, <a href="#Fig_1_7">Fig. 7</a>. The tool-point is then fed against the end by
handle <i>d</i>, <a href="#Fig_1_5">Fig. 5</a>, until a light chip is being turned off, and then
it is moved outward by handle <i>e</i> (as indicated by the arrow at
<i>B</i>, <a href="#Fig_1_7">Fig. 7</a>), the carriage remaining stationary. As the movement
of the tool-point is guided by the cross-slide <i>D</i>, which is at
right angles with the axis of the work, the end will be faced
square. For short turning operations of this kind, the power
feeds ordinarily are not used as they are intended for comparatively
long cuts. If it were necessary to remove much
metal from the end, a number of cuts would be taken across it;
in this case, however, the rough stock is only <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">8</sub> inch too long so
that this end need only be made true.</p>

<p>After taking a cut as described, the surface, if left rough by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_9" id="Pg_9">[9]</a></span>
the tool-point, should be made smooth by a second or finishing
cut. If the tool is ground slightly round at the point and the
cutting edge is set almost square, as at <i>C</i>, <a href="#Fig_1_7">Fig. 7</a>, a smooth finish
can be obtained; the cut, however, should be light and the outward
feed uniform. The work is next reversed in the centers
and the driving dog is placed on the end just finished; the other
end is then faced, enough metal being removed to make the
piece 14<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub> inches long, as required in this particular case. This
completes the facing operation. If the end of the work does
not need to be perfectly square, the facing operation can be performed
by setting the tool in a right-angled position and then
feeding it sidewise, thus removing a chip equal to the width of
one side. Evidently this method is confined to comparatively
small diameters and the squareness of the turned end will be
determined by the position of the tool's cutting edge.</p>

<a name="Secnum_1_4" id="Secnum_1_4"></a><p><b>Turning Tool&mdash;Turning Work Cylindrical.</b>&mdash;The tool used to
turn the body to the required diameter is shaped differently
from the side-tool, the cutting edge <i>E</i> of most tools used for
plain cylindrical turning being curved as shown in <a href="#Fig_1_8">Fig. 8</a>. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_10" id="Pg_10">[10]</a></span>
tool of this shape can be used for a variety of cylindrical turning
operations. As most of the work is done by that part of
the edge marked by arrow <i>a</i>, the top of the tool is ground to
slope back from this part to give it keenness. The end <i>F</i>, or
the flank, is also ground to an angle to provide clearance for the
cutting edge. If the tool did not have this clearance, the flank
would rub against the work and prevent the cutting edge from
entering the metal. This type of tool is placed about square
with the work, for turning, and with the cutting end a little
above the center.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 9. Setting Calipers by Scale&mdash;Setting by Gage&mdash;Fixed Gage</p>
</div>

<p>Before beginning to turn, a pair of outside calipers or a micrometer
should be set to 2<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">4</sub> inches, which, in this case, is the
finished diameter of the work. Calipers are sometimes set by
using a graduated scale as at <i>A</i>, <a href="#Fig_1_9">Fig. 9</a>, or they can be adjusted
to fit a standard cylindrical gage of the required size as at <i>B</i>.
Very often fixed caliper gages <i>C</i> are used instead of the adjustable
spring calipers. These fixed gages, sometimes called &#8220;snap&#8221;
gages, are accurately made to different sizes, and they are particularly
useful when a number of pieces have to be turned to
exactly the same size.</p>

Hand when Starting a Cut&mdash;<br />View to Left, Feeding Tool Laterally;<br />View to
Right, Feeding Tool in a Lengthwise Direction</p>
</div>

<p>The turning tool is started at the right-hand end of the work
and the tool should be adjusted with the left hand when beginning
a cut, as shown in <a href="#Fig_1_10">Fig. 10</a>, in order to have the right hand
free for calipering. A short space is first turned by hand feeding,
as at <i>D</i>, <a href="#Fig_1_7">Fig. 7</a>, and when the calipers show that the diameter is
slightly greater than the finished size (to allow for a light finishing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_11" id="Pg_11">[11]</a></span>
cut, either in the lathe or grinding machine) the power feed
for the carriage is engaged; the tool then moves along the work,
reducing it as at <i>E</i>. Evidently, if the movement is along a
line <i>b&mdash;b</i>, parallel with the axis <i>a&mdash;a</i>, the diameter <i>d</i> will be the
same at all points, and a true cylindrical piece will be turned.
On the other hand, if the axis <i>a&mdash;a</i> is inclined one way or the
other, the work will be made tapering; in fact, the tailstock
center <i>h<sub>1</sub></i> can be adjusted laterally for turning tapers, but for
straight turning, both centers must be in alignment with the
carriage travel. Most lathes have lines on the stationary and
movable parts of the tailstock base which show when the centers
are set for straight turning. These lines, however, may not be
absolutely correct, and it is good practice to test the alignment
of the centers before beginning to turn. This can be done by
taking trial cuts, at each end of the work (without disturbing
the tool's crosswise position), and then comparing the diameters,
or by testing the carriage travel with a true cylindrical piece
held between the centers as explained later.</p>

<p>If the relative positions of the lathe centers are not known,
the work should be calipered as the cut progresses to see if
the diameter <i>d</i> is the same at all points. In case the diameter
gradually increases, the tailstock center should be shifted
slightly to the rear before taking the next cut, but if the diameter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_12" id="Pg_12">[12]</a></span>
gradually diminishes, the adjustment would, of course, be made
in the opposite direction. The diameter is tested by attempting
to pass the calipers over the work. When the measuring points
just touch the work as they are gently passed across it, the
diameter being turned is evidently the same as the size to which
the calipers are set.</p>

<p>As the driving dog is on one end, the cut cannot be taken
over the entire length, and when the tool has arrived at say
position <i>x</i>, <a href="#Fig_1_5">Fig. 5</a>, it is returned to the starting point and the
work is reversed in the centers, the dog being placed upon the
other end. The unfinished part is then turned, and if the cross-slide
is not moved, the tool will meet the first cut. It is not
likely that the two cuts will be joined or blended together perfectly,
however, and for this reason a cut should be continuous
when this is possible.</p>

<a name="Secnum_1_5" id="Secnum_1_5"></a><p><b>Roughing and Finishing Cuts.</b>&mdash;Ordinarily in lathe work, as
well as in other machine work, there are two classes of cuts,
known as &#8220;roughing&#8221; and &#8220;finishing&#8221; cuts.
Roughing cuts are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_13" id="Pg_13">[13]</a></span>
for reducing the work as quickly as possible almost to the required
size, whereas finishing cuts, as the name implies, are intended
to leave the part smooth and of the proper size. When
the rough stock is only a little larger than the finished diameter,
a single cut is sufficient, but if there is considerable metal to
turn away, one or more deep roughing cuts would have to be
taken, and, finally, a light cut for finishing. In this particular
case, one roughing and one finishing cut would doubtless be
taken, as the diameter has to be reduced <sup class="enum">3</sup>/<sub class="denom">8</sub> inch. Ordinarily the
roughing cut would be deep enough to leave the work about <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">32</sub>
or perhaps <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">16</sub> inch above the finished size. When there is considerable
metal to remove and a number of roughing cuts have
to be taken, the depth of each cut and the feed of the tool are
governed largely by the pulling power of the lathe and the
strength of the work to withstand the strain of a heavy cut.
The depth of roughing cuts often has to be reduced considerably
because the part being turned is so flexible that a heavy cut
would spring the work and cause the tool to gouge in. Of
course, just as few cuts as possible should be taken in order to
save time. The speed of the work should also be as fast as the
conditions will allow for the same reason, but as there are many
things which govern the speed, the feed of the tool, and the
depth of the cut, these important points are referred to separately
in <a href="#Chapnum_2">Chapter II</a>.</p>

<a name="Fig_1_11" id="Fig_1_11"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/022sm.jpg" alt="Filing Work" />
<p class="caption750">Fig. 11. Filing Work after Finishing Cut is taken</p>
</div>

<a name="Secnum_1_6" id="Secnum_1_6"></a><p><b>Filing and Finishing.</b>&mdash;In many cases the last or finishing
cut does not leave as smooth a surface as is required and it is
necessary to resort to other means. The method commonly
employed for finishing in the lathe is by the use of a file and
emery cloth. The work is rotated considerably faster for filing
than for turning, and the entire surface is filed by a flat, single-cut
file, held as shown in <a href="#Fig_1_11">Fig. 11</a>. The file is passed across the
work and advanced sidewise for each forward stroke, until the
entire surface is finished. The file should be kept in contact
with the work continually, but on the return stroke the pressure
should be relieved. The movement of the file during the forward
or cutting stroke should be much slower than when filing
in a vise. By moving the file slowly, the work can make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_14" id="Pg_14">[14]</a></span>
number of revolutions for each stroke, which tends to keep it
round, as practically the same amount of metal is removed from
the entire circumference. On the other hand, short rapid strokes
tend to produce flat spots, or at least an irregular surface, especially
if the work can only make part of a revolution for
each cutting stroke. The pressure on the file during the forward
stroke should also be kept as nearly uniform as possible.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to file a part smooth and at the same time
to keep it round and cylindrical, and the more filing that has to
be done, the greater the chance of error. For this reason, the
amount left for filing should be very small; in fact, the metal
removed by filing should be just enough to take out the tool
marks and give a smooth finish. Very often a satisfactory
finish can be obtained with a turning tool, and filing is not
necessary at all. The file generally used for lathe work is a
&#8220;single-cut bastard&#8221; of &#8220;mill&#8221; section, having a length of from
12 to 14 inches.</p>

<p>Sometimes particles of metal collect between the teeth of a
file and make deep scratches as the file is passed across the
work. When this occurs, the teeth should be cleaned by using<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_15" id="Pg_15">[15]</a></span>
a wire brush or a file card, which is drawn across the file in the
direction of the teeth. This forming of tiny particles between
the teeth is known as &#8220;pinning&#8221; and it can sometimes be avoided
by rubbing chalk on the file. Filing is not only done to obtain
a smooth finish, but also to reduce the work to an exact diameter,
as a very slight reduction can be made in this way.</p>

<p>If a polish is desired, this can be obtained by holding a piece
of emery cloth tightly around the work as it revolves. The
coarseness of emery cloth is indicated by letters and numbers
corresponding to the grain number of loose emery. The letters
and numbers for grits ranging from fine to coarse are as follows:
<i>FF</i>, <i>F</i>, 120, 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 54, 46, 40. For large work
roughly filed, use coarse cloth such as Nos. 46 or 54, and then
finer grades to obtain the required polish. If the work has been
carefully filed, a good polish can be obtained with Nos. 60 and
90 cloth, and a brilliant polish by finishing with No. 120 and
flour-emery.</p>

<p>Most cylindrical parts can be finished more quickly and
accurately in the grinder than in the lathe, and many classes of
work are, at the present time, simply rough-turned in the lathe
and then ground to size in a cylindrical grinding machine.</p>

<b>Aligning Centers for Cylindrical Turning.</b>&mdash;Whena rod or
shaft must be turned cylindrical or to the same diameter throughout
its entire length, it is good practice to test the alignment
of the centers, before inserting the work. The position of the
tailstock center for cylindrical turning may be indicated by the
coincidence of graduation marks on the base, but if accuracy is
necessary, the relative position of the two centers should be determined
in a more positive way. A very simple and convenient
method of testing the alignment is shown at <i>A</i> in <a href="#Fig_1_12">Fig. 12</a>. The
work is first turned for a short distance, near the dogged end, as
shown, and the tool is left as set for this cut; then the tailstock
center is withdrawn and the work is moved sufficiently to
permit running the tool back to the tailstock end without changing
its original setting. A short cut is then taken at this end
and the diameters <i>d</i> and <i>d<sub>1</sub></i> are carefully compared. In case
there is any variation, the tailstock center is adjusted laterally,
other trial cuts are taken, and the test repeated.</p>

<p>Another method is illustrated at <i>B</i>, which requires the use of
a test-bar <i>t</i>. This bar should have accurately made centers and
the ends finished to exactly the same diameter. The lathe
centers are aligned by placing the bar between them and then
testing the position of the ends. This can be done by comparing
each end with a tool held in the toolpost and moved from
one to the other by shifting the carriage, but a better method
is to clamp a test indicator <i>i</i> in the toolpost and bring it in contact
with first one end of the bar and then the other. If the dial
does not register the same at each end, it shows that the lathe
centers are not in line. Even when centers are correctly set,
lathes that have been in use a long time do not always turn
cylindrical or straight, because if the ways that guide the carriage
are worn unevenly, the tool as it moves along does not
remain in the same plane and this causes a variation in the
diameter of the part being turned.</p>

</div>

<a name="Secnum_1_8" id="Secnum_1_8"></a><p><b>Application of Drivers or Dogs.</b>&mdash;Work that is turned between
centers is sometimes driven by a dog which is so short
for the faceplate that the bent driving end bears against the
bottom <i>a</i> of the faceplate slot, as shown at <i>A</i>, <a href="#Fig_1_13">Fig. 13</a>. If the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_17" id="Pg_17">[17]</a></span>
dog is nearly the right length, it may allow the headstock center
to enter the center in the work part way, with the result that
the turned surface is not true with the centers. When a driving
dog of this type is used, care should be taken to see that it moves
freely in the faceplate slot and does not bind against the bottom.
By using a straight dog (<i>B</i>), which is driven by a pin <i>b</i> bolted
to the faceplate, all danger from this source is eliminated. The
straight dog, however, is used more particularly to do away
with the leverage <i>l</i> of a bent dog, as this leverage tends to spring
a flexible part when a cut is being taken.</p>

<p>Straight dogs are also made with two driving ends which
engage pins on opposite sides of the faceplate. This type is
preferable because it applies the power required for turning,
evenly to the work, which still further reduces the tendency to
spring it out of shape. The principal objection to the double-ended
type lies in the difficulty of adjusting the driving pins
so that each bears with equal pressure against the dog. The
double-ended driver is often used for large work especially if
deep roughing cuts are necessary.</p>

<a name="Secnum_1_9" id="Secnum_1_9"></a><p><b>Lathe Arbors or Mandrels.</b>&mdash;When it is necessary to turn
the outside of a part having a hole through it, centers cannot,
of course, be drilled in the ends and other means must be resorted
to. We shall assume that the bushing <i>B</i>, <a href="#Fig_1_14">Fig. 14</a>, has a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_18" id="Pg_18">[18]</a></span>
finished hole through the center, and it is desired to turn the
outside cylindrical and concentric with the hole. This could be
done by forcing a tightly-fitted arbor <i>M</i>, having accurately-centered
ends, into the bushing and inserting the mandrel and
work between the lathe centers <i>h</i> and <i>h<sub>1</sub></i> as shown. Evidently,
if the arbor runs true on its centers, the hole in the bushing will
also run true and the outside can be turned the same as though
the arbor and bushing were a solid piece. From this it will be
seen that an arbor simply forms a temporary support for parts
that are bored and therefore cannot be centered.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 15. Turning Pulley Held on an Arbor</p>
</div>

<p>Another example of work that would be turned on an arbor
is shown in <a href="#Fig_1_15">Fig. 15</a>. This is a small cast-iron wheel having a
finished hole through the hub, and the outer surface and sides
of the rim are to be turned true with this hole. In this case, the
casting would also be held by pressing a mandrel through the
hub; as shown. This method, however, would only apply to
comparatively small wheels because it would be difficult, if not
impossible, to prevent a large wheel from turning on the arbor
when taking a cut, and even if it could be driven, large work
could be done to better advantage on another type of machine.
(The vertical boring mill is used extensively for turning large
wheels, as explained in <a href="#Chapnum_6">Chapter VI</a>.) When turning the outside
of the rim, a tool similar to that shown at <i>t</i> should be used, but
for facing or turning the sides, it might be better, if not necessary,
to use tools having bent ends as shown by the dotted lines; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_19" id="Pg_19">[19]</a></span>
fact, turning tools of various kinds are made with the ends bent
to the right or left, as this enables them to be used on surfaces
that could not be reached very well with a straight tool. If a
comparatively large pulley is mounted near the end of the
arbor, it can be driven directly by pins attached to the faceplate
and engaging the pulley arms. This method of driving is
often employed when the diameter to be turned is large and the
hole for the arbor is so small that there will not be sufficient
friction for driving.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 16. Different Types of Lathe Arbors</p>
</div>

<a name="Secnum_1_10" id="Secnum_1_10"></a><p><b>Different Types of Lathe Arbors.</b>&mdash;Three different types of
lathe arbors are shown in <a href="#Fig_1_16">Fig. 16</a>. The kind shown at <i>A</i> is
usually made of tool steel and the body is finished to a standard
size. The ends are somewhat reduced and flat spots are milled,
as shown, to give the clamping screw of the dog a good grip.
The body of the arbor is usually tapered about 0.006 inch per
foot. This taper makes it easier to insert the arbor in a close-fitting
hole, and it also permits slight variations in the diameter
of different holes. As to hardening, the practice at the present
time among manufacturers is to harden arbors all over, but for
extremely accurate work, an arbor having hardened ends and a
soft body is generally considered superior, as there is less tendency
of distortion from internal stresses. Hardened arbors are &#8220;seasoned&#8221;
before finish-grinding to relieve these internal stresses.</p>

<p>The solid type <i>A</i>, <a href="#Fig_1_16">Fig. 16</a>, is used very extensively, but in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_20" id="Pg_20">[20]</a></span>
shops where a great variety of work is being done and there are
many odd-sized holes, some form of expanding arbor <i>B</i> can be
used to advantage. This type, instead of being solid, consists
of a tapering inner arbor <i>M</i> on which is placed a split bushing
that can be expanded, within certain limits, by driving in the
tapering member. The advantage of this type is that a comparatively
small stock of arbors is required, as different-sized
bushings can be used. This type can also be fitted to holes of
odd sizes, whereas a solid arbor must be provided for each
different size hole, unless the variation is very slight. The latter
are, however, more accurate than the expanding type.</p>

<p>Another form of expanding arbor is shown at <i>C</i>. This type
has a straight body <i>N</i> in which four tapering grooves are cut
lengthwise, as shown, and there is a sleeve <i>S</i>, containing four
slots that are located to correspond with the tapering grooves.
Strips s are fitted into these slots, and as the part <i>N</i> is driven in,
the strips are moved outward as they ascend the tapering grooves.
By having different sets of these strips of various heights, one
arbor of this type can be made to cover quite a range of sizes.
It is not suited, however, to thin work, as the pressure, being
concentrated in four places, would spring a flexible part out of
shape.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 17. (A) Cone Arbor.<br />(B) Nut Arbor.<br />(C) Pipe Center</p>
</div>

<p>The cone arbor or mandrel shown at <i>A</i>, in <a href="#Fig_1_17">Fig. 17</a>, is convenient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_21" id="Pg_21">[21]</a></span>
for holding parts having comparatively large holes, as
it can be adjusted for quite a range of diameters. The work is
gripped between the two cones <i>c</i> and <i>c<sub>1</sub></i> which are forced together
by nut <i>n</i>. The cones are prevented from turning upon the
arbor by keys. This style of arbor should not be used for
accurate work. The threaded arbor <i>B</i> is used for facing the sides
of nuts square with the tapped hole. When a nut is first put
upon the arbor, the rough side comes against an equalizing
washer <i>w</i>. This washer rests against a spherical seat so that it
can shift to provide a uniform bearing for the rough side of the
nut, even though it is not square with the tapped hole. This
feature prevents the nut from being canted on the arbor and
insures an accurately faced nut. The revolving conical center
shown at <i>C</i> is often used for holding a pipe or tube while turning
the outside. The cone is adjusted to fit into the hole of
the pipe, by means of the tailstock spindle, and the opposite
end is usually held in a chuck.</p>

<p>Particular care should be taken to preserve the accuracy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_22" id="Pg_22">[22]</a></span>
the centers of lathe arbors by keeping them clean and well-oiled
while in use.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 18. Press for Forcing Arbors into Work</p>
</div>

<a name="Secnum_1_11" id="Secnum_1_11"></a><p><b>Mandrel or Arbor Press.</b>&mdash;The best method of inserting an
arbor of the solid type in a hole is by using a press, <a href="#Fig_1_18">Fig. 18</a>,
designed for that purpose, but if such a press is not available
and it is necessary to drive the mandrel in, a &#8220;soft&#8221; hammer,
made of copper, lead or other soft material, should be used to protect
the centered end of the arbor. In either case, the arbor should
not be forced in too tightly, for if it fits properly, this will not
be necessary in order to hold the work securely. On the other
hand, the work might easily be broken by attempting to force
the arbor in as far and as tightly as possible. In using the
arbor press, the work is placed on the base <i>B</i> with the hole in a
vertical position, and the arbor (which
should be oiled slightly) is forced down into it by ram <i>R</i>,
operated by lever <i>L</i>. Slots are provided in the base, as shown,
so that the end of the arbor can come through at the bottom
of the hole. The lever of this particular press is counter-weighted
so that it rises to a vertical position when released.
The ram can then be adjusted quickly to any required height
by the handwheel seen at the left.</p>

<p>Some shops are equipped with power-driven mandrel or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_23" id="Pg_23">[23]</a></span>
arbor presses. This type is particularly desirable for large
work, owing to the greater pressure required for inserting mandrels
that are comparatively large in diameter. One well-known
type of power press is driven by a belt, and the downward
pressure of the ram is controlled by a handwheel. The ram is
raised or lowered by turning this handwheel in one direction or
the other, and a gage shows how much pressure is being applied.
This type of press can also be used for other purposes, such as
forcing bushings or pins into or out of holes, bending or straightening
parts, or for similar work.</p>

<a name="Secnum_1_12" id="Secnum_1_12"></a><p><b>Steadyrest for Supporting Flexible Parts.</b>&mdash;Occasionally
long slender shafts, rods, etc., which have to be turned, are so
flexible that it is necessary to support them at some point between
the lathe centers. An attachment for the lathe known
as a steadyrest is often used for this purpose. A steadyrest is
composed of a frame containing three jaws <i>J</i> (<a href="#Fig_1_19">Fig. 19</a>), that can
be adjusted in or out radially by turning screws <i>S</i>. The frame
is hinged at <i>h</i>, thus allowing the upper half to be swung back
(as shown by the dotted lines) for inserting or removing the
work. The bolt-clamp <i>c</i> holds the hinged part in the closed
position. The base of the frame has V-grooves in it that fit
the ways of the lathe bed. When the steadyrest is in use, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_24" id="Pg_24">[24]</a></span>
secured to the bed by clamp <i>C</i>, and the jaws <i>J</i> are set in against
the work, thus supporting or steadying it during the turning
operation. The steadyrest must, of course, be located at a
point where it will not interfere with the turning tool.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 20. Application of Steadyrest to a Flexible Rod</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#Fig_1_20">Fig. 20</a> shows the application of the steadyrest to a long
forged rod, having one small end, which makes it too flexible to
be turned without support. As this forging is rough, a true
surface <i>n</i> a little wider than the jaws <i>J</i> (<a href="#Fig_1_19">Fig. 19</a>) is first turned
as a bearing for the jaws. This should be done very carefully
to prevent the work from mounting the tool. A sharp pointed
tool should be used and very light cuts taken. The steadyrest
is next clamped to the lathe bed opposite the turned surface,
and the jaws are adjusted in against this surface, thus forming
a bearing. Care should be taken not to set up the jaws too
tightly, as the work should turn freely but without play. The
large part of the rod and central collar are then turned to size,
this half being machined while the small part is in the rough and
as stiff as possible. The rod is then reversed and the steadyrest
is applied to the part just finished, as shown at <i>B</i>, thus supporting
the work while the small end is being turned. That
part against which the jaws bear should be kept well oiled, and
if the surface is finished it should be protected by placing a
strip of emery cloth beneath the jaws with the emery side out;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_25" id="Pg_25">[25]</a></span>
a strip of belt leather is also used for this purpose, the object
in each case being to prevent the jaws from scratching and
marring the finished surface, as they tend to do, especially if at
all rough.</p>

<p>If the work were too flexible to permit turning a spot at <i>n</i>,
this could be done by first &#8220;spotting&#8221; it at some point <i>o</i>, and
placing the steadyrest at that point while turning another spot
at <i>n</i>.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is desirable to apply a steadyrest to a surface
that does not run true and one which is not to be turned; in
such a case a device called a &#8220;cat-head&#8221; is used. This is simply
a sleeve <i>S</i> (<a href="#Fig_1_21">Fig. 21</a>) which is placed over the untrue surface to
serve as a bearing for the steadyrest. The sleeve is made to
run true by adjusting the four set-screws at each end, and the
jaws of the steadyrest are set against it, thus supporting the
work.</p>

<a name="Secnum_1_13" id="Secnum_1_13"></a><p><b>Application of Steadyrest when Boring.</b>&mdash;Another example
illustrating the use of the steadyrest is shown in <a href="#Fig_1_22">Fig. 22</a>. The
rod <i>R</i> is turned on the outside and a hole is to be bored in the
end (as shown by dotted lines) true with the outer surface. If
the centers used for turning the rod are still in the ends, as they
would be ordinarily, this work could be done very accurately by
the following method: The rod is first placed between the centers
as for turning, with a driving dog <i>D</i> attached, and the steadyrest
jaws <i>J</i> are set against it near the outer end, as shown.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><div class="illobox450"><a name="Fig_1_23" id="Fig_1_23"></a><img src="images/035sm.png"
alt="Hold-back used when Outer End of Work is held in Steadyrest" /></div>
<p class="caption750">Fig. 23. Hold-back used when Outer End of Work is held in Steadyrest</p>
</div>

<p>Before any machine work is done, means must be provided
for holding the rod back against the headstock center <i>h</i>, because,
for an operation of this kind, the outer end cannot be supported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_26" id="Pg_26">[26]</a></span>
by the tailstock center; consequently the work tends to shift
to the right. One method of accomplishing this is shown in the
illustration. A hardwood piece <i>w</i>, having a hole somewhat
larger than the work, is clamped against the dog, in a crosswise
position, by the swinging bolts and thumb-screws shown. If the
dog is not square with the work, the wood piece should be canted
so that the bearing will not be all on one side. For large heavy
parts a similar &#8220;bridle&#8221; or &#8220;hold-back&#8221;&mdash;as this is commonly
called&mdash;is made by using steel instead of wood for the
part <i>w</i>. Another very common method which requires no
special equipment is illustrated in <a href="#Fig_1_23">Fig. 23</a>. An ordinary leather
belt lacing <i>L</i> is attached to the work and faceplate while the
latter is screwed off a few turns as shown. Then the lacing is
drawn up by hand and tied, and the faceplate is screwed onto
the spindle, thus tightening the lacing and drawing the work
against the headstock center. The method of applying the
lacing is quite clearly indicated in the illustration. If a small
driving faceplate is used, it may be necessary to drill holes for
the belt lacing, as shown.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 24. Testing Work with Dial Indicator</p>
</div>

<p>A hole is next drilled in the end of the rod by using a twist
drill in the tailstock. If the hole is finished by boring, a depth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_27" id="Pg_27">[27]</a></span>
mark should be made on the tool shank that will warn the workman
of the cutting end's approach to the bottom. A chuck can
also be used in connection with a steadyrest for doing work of
this kind, as shown in <a href="#Fig_1_24">Fig. 24</a>, the end of the rod being held and
driven by the chuck <i>C</i>. If the piece is centered, it can be held
on these centers while setting the steadyrest and adjusting the
chuck, but if the ends are without centers, a very good way is to
make light centers in the ends with a punch; after these are
properly located they are used for holding the work until the
steadyrest and chuck jaws have been adjusted. In case it is
necessary to have the end hole very accurate with the outside
of the finished rod, a test indicator <i>I</i> should be applied to the
shaft as shown. This is an instrument which shows with great
accuracy whether a rotating part runs true and it is also used
for many other purposes in machine shops. The indicator is
held in the lathe toolpost and the contact point beneath the
dial is brought against the work. If the latter does not run
true, the hand of the indicator vibrates and the graduations on
the dial show how much the work is out in thousandths of an
inch.</p>

<a name="Secnum_1_14" id="Secnum_1_14"></a><p><b>The Follow-rest.</b>&mdash;When turning long slender parts, such as
shafts, etc., a follow-rest is often used for supporting the work.
The follow-rest differs from the steadyrest in that it is attached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_28" id="Pg_28">[28]</a></span>
to and travels with the lathe carriage. The type illustrated to
the right in <a href="#Fig_1_19">Fig. 19</a> has two adjustable jaws which are located
nearly opposite the turning tool, thus providing support where
it is most needed. In using this rest, a cut is started at the
end and the jaws are adjusted to this turned part. The tool is
then fed across the shaft, which cannot spring away from the
cut because of the supporting jaws. Some follow-rests have,
instead of jaws, a bushing bored to fit the diameter being turned,
different bushings being used for different diameters. The
bushing forms a bearing for the work and holds it rigidly.
Whether a bushing or jaws are used, the turning tool is slightly
in advance of the supporting member.</p>

</div>

<a name="Secnum_1_15" id="Secnum_1_15"></a><p><b>Centering Parts to be Turned.</b>&mdash;As previously mentioned,
there are a number of different methods of forming center-holes
in the ends of parts that have to be turned while held
between lathe centers. A method of centering light work, and
one that requires few special tools, is first to locate a central
point on the end and then drill and ream the center-hole by
using the lathe itself. Hermaphrodite dividers are useful for
finding the center, as illustrated at <i>A</i>, <a href="#Fig_1_25">Fig. 25</a>, but if the work is
fairly round, a center-square <i>B</i> is preferable. A line is scribed
across the end and then another line at right angles to the first
by changing the position of the square; the intersection of these
two lines will be the center, which should be marked by striking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_29" id="Pg_29">[29]</a></span>
a pointed punch <i>C</i> with a hammer. If a cup or bell center-punch
<i>D</i> is available, it will not be necessary to first make
center lines, as the conical part shown locates the punch in a
central position. This style of punch should only be used on
work which is fairly round.</p>

<p>After small centers have been located in both ends, their
position can be tested by placing the work between the lathe
centers and rotating it rapidly by drawing the hand quickly
across it. By holding a piece of chalk close to the work as it
spins around, a mark will be made on the &#8220;high&#8221; side if the
centers are not accurate; the centers are then shifted toward
these marks. If the work is close to the finished diameter, the
centers should, of course, be located quite accurately in order
that the entire surface of the work will be turned true when it
is reduced to the finished size.</p>

</div>

<p>One method of forming these center-holes is indicated in <a href="#Fig_1_26">Fig.
26</a>. A chuck <i>C</i> is screwed onto the spindle in place of the faceplate,
and a combination center drill and reamer <i>R</i> is gripped
by the chuck jaws and set to run true. The center is then
drilled and reamed at one end by pressing the work against the
revolving drill with the tailstock spindle, which is fed out by
turning handle <i>n</i>. The piece is then reversed for drilling the
opposite end. The work may be kept from revolving while the
centers are being drilled and reamed, by attaching a dog to it
close to the tailstock end and then adjusting the cross-slide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_30" id="Pg_30">[30]</a></span>
until the dog rests upon the slide. Many parts can be held by
simply gripping them with one hand. From the foregoing it
will be seen that the small centers made by punch <i>C</i>, <a href="#Fig_1_25">Fig. 25</a>,
serve as a starting point for the drill and also as a support for
the outer end of the work while the first hole is being drilled.</p>

small straight hole a in the bottom prevents the point of the
lathe center from coming in contact with the work and insures
a good bearing on the conical surface <i>c</i>. The standard angle
for lathe centers is sixty degrees, as the illustration shows, and
the tapering part of all center-holes should be made to this

for forming centers which enables the operation to be performed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_31" id="Pg_31">[31]</a></span>
quickly. One type of centering machine is shown in <a href="#Fig_1_28">Fig. 28</a>.
The work is gripped in a chuck <i>C</i> that automatically locates it
in a central position so that it is not necessary to lay out the
end before drilling. There are two spindles <i>s</i>, one of which
holds the drill and the other the countersink, and these are
rotated by a belt passing over pulley <i>P</i>. Each of these spindles
is advanced by lever <i>L</i> and either of them can be moved to a
position central with the work, as they are mounted in a swiveling
frame. In operating this machine, a small straight hole is
first made by a twist drill held in one of the spindles; the other
spindle is then moved over to the center and the hole is reamed
tapering. The arrangement is such that neither spindle can be
advanced by the feeding lever except when in a central position.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_32" id="Pg_32">[32]</a></span>
The amount that each spindle can be advanced is limited by a
fixed collar inside the head, and there is also a swinging adjustable
stop against which the end of the work should be placed
before tightening the chuck. These two features make it possible
to ream center holes of the same size or depth in any
number of pieces.</p>

<a name="Secnum_1_17" id="Secnum_1_17"></a><p><b>Different Forms of Centers.</b>&mdash;In some poorly equipped shops
it is necessary to form centers by the use of a center-punch
only, as there is no better tool. If the end of the punch has a
sixty-degree taper, a fair center can be formed in this way, but
it is not a method to be recommended, especially when accurate
work is required. Sometimes centers are made with punches
that are too blunt, producing a shallow center, such as the one
shown in the upper left-hand view, <a href="#Fig_1_27">Fig. 27</a>. In this case all the
bearing is on the point of the lathe center, which is the worst
possible place for it. Another way is to simply drill a straight
hole as in the upper view to the right; this is also bad practice
in more than one respect. The lower view to the right shows
a form of center which is often found in the ends of lathe arbors,
the mouth of the center being rounded, at <i>r</i>, and the arbor end
recessed as shown. The rounded corner prevents the point of
the lathe center from catching when it is moved rapidly towards
work which is not being held quite centrally (as shown by the
illustration), and the end is recessed to protect the center against
bruises. Stock that is bent should always be straightened before
the centers are drilled and reamed. If the work is first
centered and then straightened the bearing on the lathe center
would be as shown in <a href="#Fig_1_29">Fig. 29</a>. The center will then wear unevenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_33" id="Pg_33">[33]</a></span>
with the result that the surfaces last turned will not be
concentric with those which were finished first.</p>

</div>

<a name="Secnum_1_18" id="Secnum_1_18"></a><p><b>Precaution When Centering Tool Steel.</b>&mdash;Ordinarily centers
are so located that the stock runs approximately true before
being turned, but when centering tool steel to be used in making
tools, such as reamers, mills, etc., which need to be hardened,
particular care should be taken to have the rough surface run
fairly true. This is not merely to insure that the piece will
&#8220;true-up,&#8221; as there is a more important consideration, the disregard
of which often affects the quality of the finished tool.
As is well known, the degree of hardness of a piece of tool steel
that has been heated and then suddenly cooled depends upon
the amount of carbon that it contains, steel that is high in carbon
becoming much harder than that which contains less carbon.
Furthermore, the amount of carbon found at the surface, and
to some little depth below the surface of a bar of steel, is less
than the carbon content in the rest of the bar. This is illustrated
diagrammatically in <a href="#Fig_1_30">Fig. 30</a> by the shaded area in the
view to the left. (This decarbonization is probably due to the
action of the oxygen of the air on the bar during the process of
manufacture.) If stock for a reamer is so centered that the
tool removes the decarbonized surface only on one side, as
illustrated to the right, evidently when the reamer is finished
and hardened the teeth on the side <i>A</i> will be harder than those
on the opposite side, which would not have been the case if the
rough bar had been centered true. To avoid any trouble of
this kind, stock that is to be used for hardened tools should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_34" id="Pg_34">[34]</a></span>
enough larger than the finished diameter and so centered that
this decarbonized surface will be entirely removed in turning.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 31. Three Methods of Facing the Ends Square</p>
</div>

<a name="Secnum_1_19" id="Secnum_1_19"></a><p><b>Facing the Ends of Centered Stock.</b>&mdash;As a piece of work is
not properly centered until the ends are faced square, we will
consider this operation in connection with centering. Some
machinists prefer lathe centers that are cut away as shown at
<i>A</i>, <a href="#Fig_1_31">Fig. 31</a>, so that the point of the side tool can be fed in far
enough to face the end right up to the center hole. Others, instead
of using a special center, simply loosen the regular one
slightly and then, with the tool in a position as at <i>B</i>, face the
projecting teat by feeding both tool and center inward as shown
by the arrow. Whenever this method is employed, care should
be taken to remove any chips from the center hole which may
have entered. A method which makes it unnecessary to loosen
the regular center, or to use a special one, is to provide clearance
for the tool-point by grinding it to an angle of approximately
forty-five degrees, as shown at <i>C</i>. If the tool is not set
too high, it can then be fed right up to the lathe center and the
end squared without difficulty. As for the special center <i>A</i>,
the use of special tools and appliances should always be avoided
unless they effect a saving in time or their use makes it possible
to accomplish the same end with less work.</p>

<a name="Secnum_1_20" id="Secnum_1_20"></a><p><b>Truing Lathe Centers.</b>&mdash;The lathe centers should receive
careful attention especially when accurate work must be turned.
If the headstock center does not run true as it revolves with
the work, a round surface may be turned, but if the position of
the driving dog with reference to the faceplate is changed, the
turned surface will not run true because the turned surface is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_35" id="Pg_35">[35]</a></span>
not true with the work centers. Furthermore, if it is necessary
to reverse the work for finishing the dogged or driving end, the last
part turned will be eccentric to the first. Therefore, the lathe
centers should be kept true in order to produce turned surfaces
that are true or concentric with the centered ends, as it is often
necessary to change the part being turned &#8220;end for end&#8221; for
finishing, and any eccentricity between the different surfaces
would, in many cases, spoil the work.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><div class="illobox450"><img src="images/043sm.png" alt="Grinder for Truing Lathe Centers" /></div>
<p class="caption750">Fig. 32. Grinder for Truing Lathe Centers</p>
</div>

<p>Some lathes are equipped with hardened centers in both the
head-and tailstock and others have only one hardened center
which is in the tailstock. The object in having a soft or unhardened
headstock center is to permit its being trued by turning,
but as a soft center is quite easily bruised and requires
truing oftener than one that is hard, it is better to have both
centers hardened. Special grinders are used for truing these
hardened centers. One type that is very simple and easily applied
to a lathe is shown in <a href="#Fig_1_32">Fig. 32</a>. This grinder is held in the
lathe toolpost and is driven by a wheel <i>A</i> that is held in contact
with the cone-pulley. The emery wheel <i>B</i> is moved to a position
for grinding by adjusting the carriage and cross-slide, and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_36" id="Pg_36">[36]</a></span>
traversed across the conical surface of the center by handle <i>C</i>.
As the grinding proceeds, the wheel is fed inward slightly by
manipulating the cross-slide.</p>

<p>This grinder is set to the proper angle by placing the two
centered ends <i>D</i> and <i>D<sub>1</sub></i> between the lathe centers, which should
be aligned as for straight turning. The grinding spindle will
then be 30 degrees from the axis of the lathe spindle. The
grinder should be carefully clamped in the toolpost so that it
will remain as located by the centered ends. After the tailstock
center is withdrawn, the emery wheel is adjusted for grinding.
As the wheel spindle is 30 degrees from the axis of the lathe
spindle, the lathe center is not only ground true but to an
included angle of 60 degrees, which is the standard angle for
lathe centers. There are many other styles of center grinders
on the market, some of which are driven by a small belt from
the cone-pulley and others by electric motors which are connected
with ordinary lighting circuits. The tailstock center is
ground by inserting it in the spindle in place of the headstock
center. Before a center is replaced in its spindle, the hole
should be perfectly clean as even a small particle of dirt may
affect the alignment. The center in the headstock is usually
referred to as the &#8220;live center&#8221; because it turns around when
the lathe is in use, and the center in the tailstock as the &#8220;dead
center,&#8221; because it remains stationary.</p>

</div>

<a name="Secnum_1_21" id="Secnum_1_21"></a><p><b>Universal, Independent and Combination Chucks.</b>&mdash;Many
parts that are turned in the lathe are so shaped that they cannot
be held between the lathe centers like shafts and other
similar pieces and it is often necessary to hold them in a chuck
<i>A</i>, <a href="#Fig_1_33">Fig. 33</a>, which is screwed onto the lathe spindle instead of
the faceplate. The work is gripped by the jaws <i>J</i> which can be
moved in or out to accommodate various diameters. There are
three classes of chucks ordinarily used on the lathe, known as
the independent, universal and combination types. The independent
chuck is so named because each jaw can be adjusted in
or out independently of the others by turning the jaw screws S
with a wrench. The jaws of the universal chuck all move together
and keep the same distance from the center, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_37" id="Pg_37">[37]</a></span>
can be adjusted by turning any one of the screws <i>S</i>, whereas
with the independent type the chuck wrench must be applied
to each jaw screw. The combination chuck, as the name implies,
may be changed to operate either as an independent or
universal type. The advantage of the universal chuck is that
round and other parts of a uniform shape are located in a central
position for turning without any adjustment. The independent
type is, however, preferable in some respects as it is usually
stronger and adapted for holding odd-shaped pieces because
each jaw can be set to any required position.</p>

</div>

<a name="Secnum_1_22" id="Secnum_1_22"></a><p><b>Application of Chucks.</b>&mdash;As an example of chuck work, we
shall assume that the sides of disk <i>D</i>, <a href="#Fig_1_34">Fig. 34</a>, are to be turned
flat and parallel with each other and that an independent chuck
is to be used. First the chuck is screwed onto the lathe spindle
after removing the faceplate. The chuck jaws are then moved
out or in, as the case may be, far enough to receive the disk
and each jaw is set about the same distance from the center
by the aid of concentric circles on the face of the chuck. The
jaws are then tightened while the disk is held back against
them to bring the rough inner surface in a vertical plane. If
the work is quite heavy, it can be held against the chuck, before
the jaws are tightened, by inserting a piece of wood between
it and the tailstock center; the latter is then run out far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_38" id="Pg_38">[38]</a></span>
enough to force the work back. The outside or periphery of
the disk should run nearly true and it may be necessary to
move the jaws in on one side and out on the other to bring the
disk to a central position. To test its location, the lathe is
run at a moderate speed and a piece of chalk is held near the
outer surface. If the latter runs out, the &#8220;high&#8221; side will be
marked by the chalk, and this mark can be used as a guide in
adjusting the jaws. It should be remembered that the jaws are
moved only one-half the amount that the work runs out.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><div class="illobox450"><img src="images/047sm.png" alt="Tools Ground so that Top Slopes away from Working Part of Cutting Edge" /></div>
<p class="caption750">Fig. 35. Tools Ground so that Top Slopes away from Working Part of
Cutting Edge</p>
</div>

<p>A round-nosed tool <i>t</i> of the shape shown can be used for
radial facing or turning operations of the kind illustrated.
This tool is similar to the form used when turning between
centers, the principal difference being in the direction of the
top slope. The radial facing tool should be ground to slope
downward toward <i>a</i> (see <a href="#Fig_1_35">Fig. 35</a>) whereas the regular turning
tool slopes toward <i>b</i>, the inclination in each case being away
from that part of the cutting edge which does the work. The
cutting edge should be the same height as the lathe centers, and
the cut is taken by feeding the tool from the outside in to the
center. The cut is started by hand and then the power feed is
engaged, except for small surfaces. The first cut should, if
possible, be deep enough to get beneath the scale, especially if
turning cast iron, as a tool which just grazes the hard outer
surface will be dulled in a comparatively short time.</p>

<p>If it were simply necessary to turn a true flat surface and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_39" id="Pg_39">[39]</a></span>
thickness of the disk were immaterial, two cuts would be sufficient,
unless the surface were very uneven, the first or roughing
cut being followed by a light finishing cut. For a finishing cut,
the same tool could be used, but if there were a number of disks
to be faced, a square-nosed tool <i>F</i>, <a href="#Fig_1_35">Fig. 35</a>, could probably be
used to better advantage. This type has a broad flat cutting
edge that is set parallel with the rough-turned surface and this
broad edge enables a coarse feed to be taken, thus reducing the
time required for the finishing cut. If a coarse feed were taken
with the round tool, the turned surface would have spiral grooves
in it, whereas with the broad cutting edge, a smooth surface is
obtained even though the feed is coarse. The amount of feed
per revolution of the work, however, should always be less than
the width <i>w</i> of the cutting edge. Very often broad tools cannot
be used for finishing cuts, especially when turning steel,
because their greater contact causes chattering and results in a
rough surface. An old and worn lathe is more liable to chatter
than one that is heavy and well-built, and as the diameter of
the work also makes a difference, a broad tool cannot always
be used for finishing, even though, theoretically, it would be
preferable. After one side of the disk is finished, it is reversed
in the chuck, the finished surface being placed against the jaws.
The remaining rough side is then turned, care being taken when
starting the first cut to caliper the width of the disk at several
points to make sure that the two sides are parallel.</p>

<a name="Secnum_1_23" id="Secnum_1_23"></a><p><b>Example of Boring.</b>&mdash;Another example of chuck work is
shown at <i>B</i>, <a href="#Fig_1_34">Fig. 34</a>. In this case a cast-iron pulley is to have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_40"
id="Pg_40">[40]</a></span>
true hole <i>h</i> bored through the hub. (The finishing of internal
cylindrical surfaces in a lathe is referred to as boring rather than
turning.) The casting should be set true by the rim instead of
by the rough-cored hole in the hub; this can be done by the use
of chalk as previously explained. Even though a universal type
of chuck were used, the jaws of which, as will be recalled, are
self-centering, it might be necessary to turn the pulley relative
to the chuck as a casting sometimes runs out because of rough
spots or lumps which happen to come beneath one or more of
the jaws.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="Fig_1_36" id="Fig_1_36"></a>
<div class="illobox450"><img src="images/048sm.png" alt="Boring Tool" /></div>
<p class="caption750">Fig. 36. Boring Tool</p>
</div>

<p>The shape of tool <i>t</i> for boring is quite different from one used
for outside turning, as shown by <a href="#Fig_1_36">Fig. 36</a>. The cutting end of a
solid type of tool is forged approximately at right angles to the
body or shank, and the top surface is ground to slope away from
the working part <i>w</i> of the cutting edge, as with practically all
turning tools. The front part or flank, <i>f</i> is also ground away to
give the edge clearance. This type of tool is clamped in the
toolpost with the body about parallel with the lathe spindle,
and ordinarily the cutting edge would be about as high as the
center of the hole, or a little below, if anything. When starting
a cut, the tool is brought up to the work by moving the carriage
and it is then adjusted radially to get the right depth of cut, by
shifting the cross-slide. The power feed for the carriage is then
used, the tool feeding back through the hole as indicated by
the arrow, <a href="#Fig_1_34">Fig. 34</a>. In this case, as with all turning operations,
the first cut should be deep enough to remove the hard outer
scale at every part of the hole. Usually a rough-cored hole is
so much smaller than the finished size that several cuts are
necessary; in any case, the last or finishing cut should be very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_41" id="Pg_41">[41]</a></span>
light to prevent the tool from springing away from the work,
so that the hole will be as true as possible. Boring tools, particularly
for small holes, are not as rigid as those used for outside
turning, as the tool has to be small enough to enter the hole
and for this reason comparatively light cuts have to be taken.
When boring a small hole, the largest tool that will enter it
without interference should be used to get the greatest rigidity
possible.</p>

<a name="Secnum_1_24" id="Secnum_1_24"></a><p><b>Measuring Bored Holes.</b>&mdash;The diameters of small holes
that are being bored are usually measured with inside calipers
or standard gages. If the pulley were being bored to fit over
some shaft, the diameter of the shaft would first be measured by
using outside calipers, as shown at <i>A</i>, <a href="#Fig_1_37">Fig. 37</a>, the measuring
points of the calipers being adjusted until they just made contact
with the shaft when passed over it. The inside calipers
are then set as at <i>B</i> to correspond with the size of the shaft, and
the hole is bored just large enough to admit the inside calipers
easily. Very accurate measurements can be made with calipers,
but to become expert in their use requires experience. Some
mechanics never become proficient in the art of calipering because
their hands are &#8220;heavy&#8221; and they lack the sensitiveness
and delicacy of touch that is necessary. For large holes, a
gage <i>C</i> is often used, the length <i>l</i> being adjusted to the diameter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_42"
id="Pg_42">[42]</a></span>
desired. Small holes are often bored to fit hardened steel plug
gages (<a href="#Fig_1_38">Fig. 38</a>), the cylindrical measuring ends of which are
made with great accuracy to standard sizes. This type of gage
is particularly useful when a number of holes have to be bored
to the same size, all holes being made just large enough to fit
the gage without any perceptible play.</p>

</div>

<a name="Secnum_1_25" id="Secnum_1_25"></a><p><b>Setting Work in the Chuck.</b>&mdash;When setting a part in a chuck,
care should be taken to so locate it that every surface to be
turned will be true when machined to the finished size. As a
simple illustration, let us assume that the hole through the cast-iron
disk, <a href="#Fig_1_39">Fig. 39</a>, has been cored considerably out of center, as
shown. If the work is set by the outside surface <i>S</i>, as it would
be ordinarily, the hole is so much out of center that it will not
be true when bored to the finished size, as indicated by the
dotted lines. On the other hand, if the rough hole is set true,
the outside cannot be finished all over, without making the
diameter too small, when it is finally turned. In such a case,
the casting should be shifted, as shown by the arrow, to divide
the error between the two surfaces, both of which can then be
turned as shown by the dotted lines in the view to the right.
This principle of dividing the error when setting work can often
be applied in connection with turning and boring. After a casting
or other part has been set true by the most important surface,
all other surfaces which require machining should be tested to
make sure that they all can be finished to the proper size.</p>

<a name="Secnum_1_26" id="Secnum_1_26"></a><p><b>Inaccuracy from Pressure of Chuck Jaws.</b>&mdash;Work that is
held in a chuck is sometimes sprung out of shape by the pressure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_43" id="Pg_43">[43]</a></span>
of the chuck jaws so that when the part is bored or turned,
the finished surfaces are untrue after the jaws are released and
the work has resumed its normal shape. This applies more particularly
to frail parts, such as rings, thin cylindrical parts, etc.
Occasionally the distortion can be prevented by so locating the
work with relation to the chuck jaws that the latter bear against
a rigid part. When the work cannot be held tightly enough for
the roughing cuts without springing it, the jaws should be released
somewhat before taking the finishing cut, to permit the
part to spring back to its natural shape.</p>

<a name="Secnum_1_27" id="Secnum_1_27"></a><p><b>Drilling and Reaming.</b>&mdash;When a hole is to be bored from the
solid, it is necessary to drill a hole before a boring tool can be
used. One method of drilling in the lathe is to insert an ordinary
twist drill in a holder or socket <i>S</i>, <a href="#Fig_1_40">Fig. 40</a>, which is inserted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_44" id="Pg_44">[44]</a></span>
in the tailstock spindle in place of the center. The drill is then
fed through the work by turning the handle <i>n</i> and feeding the
spindle outward as shown by the arrow. Before beginning to
drill, it is well to turn a conical spot or center for the drill point
so the latter will start true. This is often done by using a special
tool having a point like a flat drill. This tool is clamped in
the toolpost with the point at the same height as the lathe
centers. It is then fed against the center of the work and a
conical center is turned. If the drill were not given this true
starting point, it probably would enter the work more or less
off center. Drills can also be started without turning a center
by bringing the square end or butt of a tool-shank held in
the toolpost in contact with the drill near the cutting end. If
the point starts off center, thus causing the drill to wobble, the
stationary tool-shank will gradually force or bump it over to
the center.</p>

end through which the drill passes, is clamped in the toolpost,
as at <i>C</i>. This slot should be set central with the lathe centers,
and the drill, when being started, should be held tightly in the
slot by turning or twisting it with a wrench as indicated in the
end view at <i>D</i>; this steadies the drill and causes it to start
fairly true even though the cored hole runs out considerably.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 43. Casting Clamped to Faceplate for Turning and Boring</p>
</div>

<a name="Secnum_1_28" id="Secnum_1_28"></a><p><b>Holding Work on Faceplate.</b>&mdash;Some castings or forgings are
so shaped that they cannot be held in a chuck very well, or perhaps
not at all, and work of this kind is often clamped to a faceplate
which is usually larger than the faceplate used for driving
parts that are turned between the centers. An example of faceplate
work is shown in <a href="#Fig_1_43">Fig. 43</a>. This is a rectangular-shaped
casting having a round boss or projection, the end <i>e</i> of which is
to be turned parallel with the back face of the casting previously
finished on a planer. A rough cored hole through the
center of the boss also needs to be bored true.</p>

<p>The best way to perform this operation in the lathe would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_46" id="Pg_46">[46]</a></span>
to clamp the finished surface of the casting directly against the
faceplate by bolts and clamps <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i>, as shown; the
work would then be turned just as though it were held in a
chuck. By holding the casting in this way, face <i>e</i> will be finished
parallel with the back surface because the latter is clamped
directly against the true-running surface of the faceplate. If a
casting of this shape were small enough it could also be held in
the jaws of an independent chuck, but if the surface e needs to
be exactly parallel with the back face, it is better to clamp the
work to the faceplate. Most lathes have two faceplates: One
of small diameter used principally for driving work turned between
centers, and a large one for holding heavy or irregularly
shaped pieces; either of these can be screwed onto the spindle,
and the large faceplate has a number of slots through which
clamping bolts can be inserted.</p>

<p>The proper way to clamp a piece to the faceplate depends, of
course, largely on its shape and the location of the surface to be
machined, but in any case it is necessary to hold it securely to
prevent any shifting after a cut is started. Sometimes castings
can be held by inserting bolts through previously drilled holes,
but when clamps are used in connection with the bolts, their
outer ends are supported by hardwood or metal blocks which
should be just high enough to make the clamp bear evenly on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_47" id="Pg_47">[47]</a></span>
the work. When deep roughing cuts have to be taken, especially
on large diameters, it is well to bolt a piece to the faceplate
and against one side of the casting, as at <i>D</i>, to act as a
driver and prevent the work from shifting; but a driver would
not be needed in this particular case. Of course a faceplate
driver is always placed to the rear, as determined by the direction
of rotation, because the work tends to shift backward when a
cut is being taken. If the surface which is clamped against the
faceplate is finished as in this case, the work will be less likely to
shift if a piece of paper is placed between it and the faceplate.</p>

<p>Work mounted on the faceplate is generally set true by some
surface before turning. As the hole in this casting should be
true with the round boss, the casting is shifted on the faceplate
until the rough outer surface of the boss runs true; the clamps
which were previously set up lightly are then tightened. The
face e is first turned by using a round-nosed tool. This tool is
then replaced by a boring tool and the hole is finished to the
required diameter. If the hole being bored is larger than the
central hole in the faceplate, the casting should be clamped
against parallel pieces, and not directly against the faceplate,
to provide clearance for the tool when it reaches the inner end
of the hole and prevent it from cutting the faceplate. The
parallel pieces should be of the same thickness and be located
near the clamps to prevent springing the casting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_48" id="Pg_48">[48]</a></span>
<a name="Secnum_1_29" id="Secnum_1_29"></a><b>Application of Angle-plate to Faceplate.</b>&mdash;Another example
of faceplate work is shown in <a href="#Fig_1_44">Fig. 44</a>. This is a cast-iron elbow
<i>E</i>, the two flanges of which are to be faced true and square
with each other. The shape of this casting is such that it would
be very difficult to clamp it directly to the faceplate, but it is
easily held on an angle-plate <i>P</i>, which is bolted to the faceplate.
The two surfaces of this angle-plate are square with
each other so that when one flange of the elbow is finished and
bolted against the angle-plate, the other will be faced square.
When setting up an angle-plate for work of this kind, the distance
from its work-holding side to the center of the faceplate is
made equal to the distance <i>d</i> between the center of one flange
and the face of the other, so that the flange to be faced will run
about true when bolted in place. As the angle-plate and work
are almost entirely on one side of the faceplate, a weight <i>W</i> is
attached to the opposite side for counterbalancing. Very often
weights are also needed to counterbalance offset parts that
are bolted directly to the faceplate. The necessity of counterbalancing
depends somewhat upon the speed to be used for
turning. If the surface to be machined is small in diameter so
that the lathe can be run quite rapidly, any unbalanced part
should always be counterbalanced.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is rather difficult to hold heavy pieces against
the vertical surface of the faceplate while applying the clamps,
and occasionally the faceplate is removed and placed in a horizontal
position on the bench; the work can then be located
about right, and after it is clamped, the faceplate is placed on
the lathe spindle by the assistance of a crane.</p>

<p>Special faceplate jaws, such as the one shown to the right in
<a href="#Fig_1_33">Fig. 33</a>, can often be used to advantage for holding work on
large faceplates. Three or four of these jaws are bolted to the
faceplate which is converted into a kind of independent chuck.
These faceplate jaws are especially useful for holding irregularly
shaped parts, as the different jaws can be located in any position.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 45. Rough Turning a Cylinder Lining&mdash;Note Method of Supporting
Outer End</p>
</div>

<a name="Secnum_1_30" id="Secnum_1_30"></a><p><b>Supporting Outer End of Chucked Work.</b>&mdash;<a href="#Fig_1_45">Fig. 45</a> shows
how the tailstock center is sometimes used for supporting the
outer end of a long casting, the opposite end of which is held in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_49" id="Pg_49">[49]</a></span>
a chuck. This particular casting is to be turned and bored to
make a lining for the cylinder of a locomotive in order to reduce
the diameter of the cylinder which has been considerably enlarged
by re-boring a number of times. These bushings are
rough-turned on the outside while the outer end is supported by
the cross-shaped piece or &#8220;spider&#8221; which forms a center-bearing
for the tailstock. This spider has set screws in the flanged
ends of the arms, which are tightened against the inner surface
of the casting and are adjusted one way or the other in order
to locate it in a concentric position. After roughing the outside,
the inside is bored to the finish size; then centered disks, which
fit into the bore, are placed in the ends of the bushing and the
latter is finish-turned. The object in rough turning the outside
prior to boring is to avoid the distortion which might occur if
this hard outer surface were removed last.</p>

<a name="Secnum_1_31" id="Secnum_1_31"></a><p><b>Boring Large Castings in
the Lathe.</b>&mdash;An ordinary engine
lathe is sometimes used for boring engine or pump cylinders,
linings, etc., which are too large to be held in the chuck or on a
faceplate, and must be attached to the lathe carriage. As a
rule, work of this class is done in a special boring machine (see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_50" id="Pg_50">[50]</a></span>
<a href="#Chapnum_7">&#8220;Horizontal Boring Machines&#8221;</a>), but if such a machine is not
available, it may be necessary to use a lathe. There are two
general methods of boring.</p>

<a name="Fig_1_46" id="Fig_1_46"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/058sm.jpg" alt="Boring a Cylinder Lining in an Ordinary Engine Lathe" />
<p class="caption750">Fig. 46. Boring a Cylinder Lining in an Ordinary Engine Lathe</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#Fig_1_46">Fig. 46</a> shows how the lining illustrated in <a href="#Fig_1_45">Fig. 45</a> is bored
in a large engine lathe. The casting is held in special fixtures
which are attached to the lathe carriage, and the boring-bar is
rotated by the lathe spindle. The tool-head of this boring-bar
carries two tools located 180 degrees apart and it is fed along
the bar by a star-feed mechanism shown attached to the bar
and the tailstock spindle. Each time the bar revolves, the star
wheel strikes a stationary pin and turns the feed-screw which,
as the illustration shows, extends along a groove cut in one
side of the bar. This feed-screw passes through a nut attached
to the tool-head so that the latter is slowly fed through the
bore. When using a bar of this type, the carriage, of course,
remains stationary.</p>

<p>Cylindrical parts attached to the carriage can also be bored
by using a plain solid bar mounted between the centers. The
bar must be provided with a cutter for small holes or a tool-head
for larger diameters (preferably holding two or more tools)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_51" id="Pg_51">[51]</a></span>
and the boring is done by feeding the carriage along the bed by
using the regular power feed of the lathe. A symmetrically
shaped casting like a bushing or lining is often held upon wooden
blocks bolted across the carriage. These are first cut away to
form a circular seat of the required radius, by using the boring-bar
and a special tool having a thin curved edge. The casting
is then clamped upon these blocks by the use of straps and
bolts, and if the curved seats were cut to the correct radius,
the work will be located concentric with the boring-bar. When
using a boring-bar of this type, the bar must be long enough to
allow the part being bored to feed from one side of the cutter-head
to the other, the cutter-head being approximately in a
central location.</p>

</div>

<a name="Secnum_1_32" id="Secnum_1_32"></a><p><b>Boring Holes to a Given Center Distance.</b>&mdash;In connection
with faceplate work, it is often necessary to bore two or more
holes at a given distance apart. The best method of doing this
may depend upon the accuracy required. For ordinary work
sometimes two or more circles <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> (<a href="#Fig_1_47">Fig. 47</a>) are drawn
upon the part to be bored, in the position for the holes; the
piece is then clamped to the faceplate and one of the circles is
centered with the lathe spindle by testing it with a pointer C
held in the toolpost; that is, when the pointer follows the circle
as the work is turned, evidently the circle is concentric with
the spindle. The hole is then drilled and bored. The other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_52" id="Pg_52">[52]</a></span>
circle is then centered in the same way for boring the second
hole. As will be seen, the accuracy of this method depends
first, upon the accuracy with which the circles were laid out,
and second; upon the care taken in setting them concentric.
For a more accurate way of locating parts for boring, see &#8220;<a href="#Secnum_3_14">Use
of Center Indicator</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="#Secnum_3_15">Locating Work by the Button
Method</a>.&#8221;</p>

<a name="Secnum_1_33" id="Secnum_1_33"></a><p><b>Turning Brass, Bronze and
Copper.</b>&mdash;When turning soft
yellow brass, a tool should be used having very little or no
slope or rake on the top surface against which the chip bears,
and for plain cylindrical turning, the point of the tool is drawn
out quite thin and rounded, by grinding, to a radius of about
<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">8</sub> or <sup class="enum">3</sup>/<sub class="denom">16</sub>
inch. If a tool having very much top slope is used for
brass, there is danger of its gouging into the metal, especially if
the part being turned is at all flexible. The clearance angle of
a brass tool is usually about 12 or 14 degrees, which is 3 or 4
degrees greater than the clearance for steel turning tools. Most
brass is easily turned, as compared with steel, and for that
reason this increase in clearance is desirable, because it facilitates
feeding the tool into the metal, especially when the carriage
and cross-slide movements are being controlled by hand
as when turning irregular shapes.</p>

<p>The speed for turning soft brass is much higher than for
steel, being ordinarily between 150 and 200 feet per minute.
When turning phosphor, tobin or other tough bronze compositions,
the tool should be ground with rake the same as for
turning steel, and lard oil is sometimes used as a lubricant.
The cutting speed for bronzes varies from 35 or 40 to 80 feet
per minute, owing to the difference in the composition of bronze
alloys.</p>

<p>Turning tools for copper are ground with a little more top
rake than is given steel turning tools, and the point should be
slightly rounded. It is important to have a keen edge, and
a grindstone is recommended for sharpening copper turning
tools. Milk is generally considered the best lubricant to use
when turning copper. The speed can be nearly as fast as for
brass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_53" id="Pg_53">[53]</a></span>
<a name="Secnum_1_34" id="Secnum_1_34"></a><b>Machining Aluminum.</b>&mdash;Tools for turning aluminum should
have acute cutting angles. After rough-grinding the tool, it is
advisable to finish sharpening the cutting edge on a grindstone
or with an oilstone for fine work, as a keen edge is very essential.
High speeds and comparatively light cuts are recommended.
The principal difficulty in the machining of aluminum and aluminum
alloys is caused by the clogging of the chips, especially
when using such tools as counterbores and milling cutters.
This difficulty can be avoided largely by using the right kind
of cutting lubricant. Soap-water and kerosene are commonly
employed. The latter enables a fine finish to be obtained, provided
the cutting tool is properly ground.</p>

<p>The following information on this subject represents the experience
of the Brown-Lipe Gear Co., where aluminum parts
are machined in large quantities: For finishing bored holes, a
bar equipped with cutters has been found more practicable than
reamers. The cutters used for machining 4-inch holes have a
clearance of from 20 to 22 degrees and no rake or slope on the
front faces against which the chips bear. The roughing cutters
for this work have a rather sharp nose, being ground on the
point to a radius of about <sup class="enum">3</sup>/<sub class="denom">32</sub> inch, but for securing a smooth
surface, the finishing tools are rounded to a radius of about
<sup class="enum">3</sup>/<sub class="denom">4</sub> inch. The cutting speed, as well as the feed, for machining
aluminum is from 50 to 60 per cent faster than the speeds and
feeds for cast iron. The lubricant used by this company is
composed of one part &#8220;aqualine&#8221; and 20 parts water. This
lubricant not only gives a smooth finish but preserves a keen
cutting edge and enables tools to be used much longer without
grinding. Formerly, a lubricant composed of one part of high-grade
lard oil and one part of kerosene was used. This mixture
costs approximately 30 cents per gallon, whereas the aqualine
and water mixture now being used costs less than 4 cents per
gallon, and has proved more effective than the lubricant formerly
employed.</p>

<h3>LATHE TURNING TOOLS AND CUTTING SPEEDS</h3>
<hr class="c05" />

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that a great variety of work can
be done in the lathe, the number of turning tools required is
comparatively small. <a href="#Fig_2_1">Fig. 1</a> shows the forms of tools that are
used principally, and typical examples of the application of
these various tools are indicated in <a href="#Fig_2_2">Fig. 2</a>. The reference letters
used in these two illustrations correspond for tools of the same
type, and both views should be referred to in connection with
the following description.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 2. Views illustrating Use of Various Types of Lathe Tools</p>
</div>

<a name="Secnum_2_1" id="Secnum_2_1"></a><p><b>Turning Tools for General Work.</b>&mdash;The tool shown at <i>A</i> is
the form generally used for rough turning, that is for taking
deep cuts when considerable metal has to be removed. At <i>B</i> a
tool of the same type is shown, having a bent end which enables
it to be used close up to a shoulder or surface <i>s</i> that might come
in contact with the tool-rest if the straight form were employed.
Tool <i>C</i>, which has a straight cutting end, is used on certain
classes of work for taking light finishing cuts, with a coarse
feed. This type of tool has a flat or straight cutting edge at
the end, and will leave a smooth finish even though the feed is
coarse, provided the cutting edge is set parallel with the tool's
travel so as to avoid ridges. Broad-nosed tools and wide feeds
are better adapted for finishing cast iron than steel. When
turning steel, if the work is at all flexible, a broad tool tends to
gouge into it and for this reason round-nosed tools and finer
feeds are generally necessary. A little experience in turning
will teach more on this point than a whole chapter on the subject.</p>

<p>The side-tools shown at <i>D</i> and <i>E</i> are for facing the ends of
shafts, collars, etc. The first tool is known as a right side-tool
because it operates on the right end or side of a shaft or collar,
whereas the left side-tool <i>E</i> is used on the opposite side, as shown
in <a href="#Fig_2_2">Fig. 2</a>. Side-tools are also bent to the right or left because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_55" id="Pg_55">[55]</a></span>
the cutting edge of a straight tool cannot always be located
properly for facing certain surfaces. A bent right side-tool is
shown at <i>F</i>. A form of tool that is frequently used is shown at
<i>G</i>; this is known as a parting tool and is used for severing pieces
and for cutting grooves, squaring corners, etc. The same type
of tool having a bent end is shown at <i>H</i> (<a href="#Fig_2_2">Fig. 2</a>) severing a piece
held in the chuck. Work that is held between centers should
not be entirely severed with a parting tool unless a steadyrest is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_56" id="Pg_56">[56]</a></span>
placed between the tool and faceplate, as otherwise the tool may
be broken by the springing of the work just before the piece is
cut in two. It should be noted that the sides of this tool slope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_57" id="Pg_57">[57]</a></span>
inward back of the cutting edge to provide clearance when
cutting in a narrow groove.</p>

<p>At <i>I</i> a thread tool is shown for cutting a U. S. standard thread.
This thread is the form most commonly used in this country at
the present time. A tool for cutting a square thread is shown
at <i>J</i>. This is shaped very much like a parting tool except that
the cutting end is inclined slightly to correspond with the helix
angle of the thread, as explained in <a href="#Chapnum_4">Chapter IV</a>, which contains
descriptions of different thread forms and methods of cutting
them. Internal thread tools are shown at <i>K</i> and <i>L</i> for cutting
U. S. standard and square threads in holes. It will be seen
that these tools are somewhat like boring tools excepting the
ends which are shaped to correspond with the thread which
they are intended to cut.</p>

<p>A tool for turning brass is shown at <i>M</i>. Brass tools intended
for general work are drawn out quite thin and they are given a
narrow rounded point. The top of the brass tool is usually
ground flat or without slope as otherwise it tends to gouge into
the work, especially if the latter is at all flexible. The end of a
brass tool is sometimes ground with a straight cutting edge for
turning large rigid work, such as brass pump linings, etc., so
that a coarse feed can be used without leaving a rough surface.
The tools at <i>N</i> and <i>O</i> are for boring or finishing drilled or cored
holes. Two sizes are shown, which are intended for small and
large holes, respectively.</p>

<p>The different tools referred to in the foregoing might be called
the standard types because they are the ones generally used,
and as <a href="#Fig_2_2">Fig. 2</a> indicates, they make it possible to turn an almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_58" id="Pg_58">[58]</a></span>
endless variety of forms. Occasionally some special form of
tool is needed for doing odd jobs, having, perhaps, an end bent
differently or a cutting edge shaped to some particular form.
Tools of the latter type, which are known as &#8220;form tools,&#8221; are
sometimes used for finishing surfaces that are either convex,
concave, or irregular in shape. The cutting edges of these
tools are carefully filed or ground to the required shape, and
the form given the tool is reproduced in the part turned. Ornamental
or other irregular surfaces can be finished very neatly
by the use of such tools. It is very difficult, of course, to turn
convex or concave surfaces with a regular tool; in fact, it would
not be possible to form a true spherical surface, for instance,
without special equipment, because the tool could not be moved
along a true curve by simply using the longitudinal and cross
feeds. Form tools should be sharpened by grinding entirely on
the top surface, as any grinding on the end or flank would alter
the shape of the tool.</p>

<a name="Secnum_2_2" id="Secnum_2_2"></a><p><b>Tool-holders with Inserted Cutters.</b>&mdash;All of the tools shown
in Fig. 1 are forged from the bar, and when the cutting ends
have been ground down considerably it is necessary to forge a
new end. To eliminate the expense of this continual dressing of
tools and also to effect a great reduction in the amount of tool
steel required, tool-holders having small inserted cutters are
used in many shops. A tool-holder of this type, for outside
turning, is shown in <a href="#Fig_2_3">Fig. 3</a>. The cutter <i>C</i> is held in a fixed
position by the set-screw shown, and it is sharpened, principally,
by grinding the end, except when it is desired to give the top of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_59" id="Pg_59">[59]</a></span>
the cutter a different slope from that due to its angular position.
Another inserted-cutter turning tool is shown in <a href="#Fig_2_4">Fig. 4</a>, which
is a heavy type intended for roughing. The cutter in this case
has teeth on the rear side engaging with corresponding teeth
cut in the clamping block which is tightened by a set-screw on
the side opposite that shown. With this arrangement, the cutter
can be adjusted upward as the top is ground away.</p>

shows a boring tool consisting of a holder <i>H</i>, a bar <i>B</i> that can
be clamped in any position, and an inserted cutter <i>C</i>. With this
type of boring tool, the bar can be extended beyond the holder
just far enough to reach through the hole to be bored, which
makes the tool very rigid. A thread tool of the holder type is
shown in <a href="#Fig_2_7">Fig. 7</a>. The angular edge of the cutter <i>C</i> is accurately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_60" id="Pg_60">[60]</a></span>
ground by the manufacturers, so that the tool is sharpened by
simply grinding it flat on the top. As the top is ground away,
the cutter is raised by turning screw <i>S</i>, which can also be used
for setting the tool to the proper height.</p>

</div>

<a name="Secnum_2_3" id="Secnum_2_3"></a><p><b>The Position of Turning Tools.</b>&mdash;The production of accurate
lathe work depends partly on the condition of the lathe used
and also on the care and judgment exercised by the man operating
it. Even though a lathe is properly adjusted and in good
condition otherwise, errors are often made which are due to
other causes which should be carefully avoided. If the turning
tool is clamped so that the cutting end extends too far from the
supporting block, the downward spring of the tool, owing to
the thrust of the cut, sometimes results in spoiled work, especially
when an attempt is made to turn close to the finished
size by taking a heavy roughing cut. Suppose the end of a
cylindrical part is first reduced for a short distance by taking
several trial cuts until the diameter <i>d</i>, <a href="#Fig_2_8">Fig. 8</a>, is slightly above
the finished size and the power feed is then engaged. When
the tool begins to take the full depth <i>e</i> of the cut, the point,
which ordinarily would be set a little above the center, tends to
spring downward into the work, and if there were considerable
springing action, the part would probably be turned below the
finished size, the increased reduction beginning at the point
where the full cut started.</p>

<p>This springing action, as far as the tool is concerned, can be
practically eliminated by locating the tool so that the distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_61" id="Pg_61">[61]</a></span>
<i>A</i> between the tool-block and cutting end, or the &#8220;overhang,&#8221;
is as short as possible. Even though the tool has little overhang
it may tilt downward because the toolslide is loose on its ways,
and for this reason the slide should have a snug adjustment
that will permit an easy movement without unnecessary play.
The toolslides of all lathes are provided with gibs which can
be adjusted by screws to compensate for wear, or to secure a
more rigid bearing.</p>

Radial Surfaces</p>
</div>

<p>When roughing cuts are to be taken, the tool should be located
so that any change in its position which might be caused by the
pressure of the cut will not spoil the work. This point is illustrated
at <i>A</i> in <a href="#Fig_2_9">Fig. 9</a>. Suppose the end of a rod has been reduced
by taking a number of trial cuts, until it is <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">32</sub> inch above the
finished size. If the power feed is then engaged with the tool
clamped in an oblique position, as shown, when the full cut is
encountered at <i>c</i>, the tool, unless very tightly clamped, may be
shifted backward by the lateral thrust of the cut, as indicated
by the dotted lines. The point will then begin turning smaller
than the finished size and the work will be spoiled. To prevent
any change of position, it is good practice, especially when
roughing, to clamp the tool square with the surface being turned,
or in other words, at right angles to its direction of movement.
Occasionally, however, there is a decided advantage in having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_62" id="Pg_62">[62]</a></span>
the tool set at an angle. For example, if it is held about as
shown at <i>B</i>, when turning the flange casting <i>C</i>, the surfaces <i>s</i>
and <i>s<sub>1</sub></i> can be finished without changing the tool's position.
Cylindrical and radial surfaces are often turned in this way
in order to avoid shifting the tool, especially when machining
parts in quantity.</p>

<a name="Secnum_2_4" id="Secnum_2_4"></a><p><b>Tool Grinding.</b>&mdash;In the grinding of lathe tools there are
three things of importance to be considered: First, the cutting
edge of the tool (as viewed from the top) needs to be given a
certain shape; second, there must be a sufficient amount of
clearance for the cutting edge; and third, tools, with certain
exceptions, are ground with a backward slope or a side slope,
or with a combination of these two slopes on that part against
which the chip bears when the tool is in use.</p>

<a name="Fig_2_10" id="Fig_2_10"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><div class="illobox450"><img src="images/071sm.png" alt="Illustration showing the Meaning of Terms used in Tool Grinding as applied to Tools of Different Types" /></div>
<p class="caption750">Fig. 10. Illustration showing the Meaning of Terms used<br />in Tool
Grinding as applied to Tools of Different Types</p>
</div>

<p>In <a href="#Fig_2_10">Fig. 10</a> a few of the different types of tools which are used
in connection with lathe work are shown. This illustration also
indicates the meaning of the various terms used in tool grinding.
As shown, the clearance of the tool is represented by the
angle <i>&alpha;</i>, the back slope is represented by the angle <i>&beta;</i>, and the
side slope by the angle <i>&gamma;</i>. The angle <i>&delta;</i> for a tool without side
slope is known as the lip angle or the angle of keenness. When,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_63" id="Pg_63">[63]</a></span>
however, the tool has both back and side slopes, this lip angle
would more properly be the angle between the flank <i>f</i> and the
top of the tool, measured diagonally along a line <i>z&mdash;z</i>. It will
be seen that the lines <i>A&mdash;B</i> and <i>A&mdash;C</i> from which the angles
of clearance and back slope are measured are parallel with the
top and sides of the tool shank, respectively. For lathe tools,
however, these lines are not necessarily located in this way
when the tool is in use, as the height of the tool point with
relation to the work center determines the position of these
lines, so that the <i>effective</i> angles of back slope, clearance and
keenness are changed as the tool point is lowered or raised.
The way the position of the tool affects these angles will be
explained later.</p>

<p>While tools must, of necessity, be varied considerably in shape
to adapt them to various purposes, there are certain underlying
principles governing their shape which apply generally;
so in what follows we shall not attempt to explain in detail just
what the form of each tool used on the lathe should be, as it is
more important to understand how the cutting action of the
tool and its efficiency is affected when it is improperly ground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_64" id="Pg_64">[64]</a></span>
When the principle is understood, the grinding of tools of various
types and shapes is comparatively easy.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><div class="illobox450"><img src="images/072sm.png" alt="Plan View of Lathe Turning and Threading Tools" /></div>
<p class="caption750">Fig. 11. Plan View of Lathe Turning and Threading Tools</p>
</div>

<a name="Secnum_2_5" id="Secnum_2_5"></a><p><b>Shape or Contour of Cutting Edge.</b>&mdash;In the first place we
shall consider the shape or contour of the cutting edge of the
tool as viewed from the top, and then take up the question of
clearance and slope, the different elements being considered
separately to avoid confusion. The contour of the cutting edge
depends primarily upon the purpose for which the tool is intended.
For example, the tool <i>A</i>, in <a href="#Fig_2_11">Fig. 11</a>, where a plan view
of a number of different lathe tools is shown, has a very different
shape from that of, say, tool <i>D</i>, as the first tool is used for rough
turning, while tool <i>D</i> is intended for cutting grooves or severing
a turned part. Similarly, tool <i>E</i> is V-shaped because it is used
for cutting V-threads. Tools <i>A</i>, <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, however, are regular
turning tools; that is, they are all intended for turning plain
cylindrical surfaces, but the contour of the cutting edges varies
considerably, as shown. In this case it is the characteristics of
the work and the cut that are the factors which determine the
shape. To illustrate, tool <i>A</i> is of a shape suitable for rough-turning
large and rigid work, while tool <i>B</i> is adapted for smaller
and more flexible parts. The first tool is well shaped for roughing
because experiments have shown that a cutting edge of a
large radius is capable of higher cutting speed than could be
used with a tool like <i>B</i>, which has a smaller point. This increase<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Pg_65" id="Pg_65">[65]</a></span>
in the cutting speed is due to the fact that the tool <i>A</i>
removes a thinner chip for a given feed than tool <i>B</i>; therefore,
the speed may be increased without injuring the cutting edge
to the same extent. If, however, tool <i>A</i> were to be used for
turning a long and flexible part, chattering might result; consequently,
a tool <i>B</i> having a point with a smaller radius would
be preferable, if not absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>The character of the work also affects the shape of tools.
The tool shown at <i>C</i> is used for taking light finishing cuts with
a wide feed. Obviously, if the straight or flat part of the cutting
edge is in line with the travel of the tool, the cut will be smooth
and free from ridges, even though the feed is coarse, and by
using a coarse feed the cut is taken in less time; but such a
tool cannot be used on work that is not rigid, as chattering
would result. Therefore, a smaller cutting point and a reduced
feed would have to be employed. Tools with broad flat cutting
edges and coarse feeds are often used for taking finishing cuts
in cast iron, as this metal offers less resistance to cutting than
steel, and is less conducive to chattering.</p>

<p>The shape of a tool (as viewed from the top) which is intended
for a more specific purpose than regular turning, can be largely
determined by simply considering the tool under working conditions.
This point may be illustrated by the parting tool <i>D</i>
which, as previously stated, is used for cutting grooves, squaring
corners, etc. Evidently this tool should be widest at the
cutting edge; that is, the sides <i>d</i> should have a slight amount
of clearance so that they will not bind as the tool is fed into a
groove. As the tool at <i>E</i> is for cutting a V-thread, the angle <i>&alpha;</i>
between its cutting edges must equal the angle between the
sides of a V-thread, or 60 degrees. The tool illustrated at <i>F</i> is
for cutting inside square threads. In this case the width <i>w</i>
should be made equal to one-half the pitch of the thread (or
slightly greater to provide clearance for the screw), and the
sides should be given a slight amount of side clearance, the
same as with the parting tool <i>D</i>. So we see that the outline of
the tool, as viewed from the top, must conform to and be governed
by its use.</p>

<a name="Secnum_2_6" id="Secnum_2_6"></a><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_66" id="Pg_66">[66]</a></span>
<b>Direction of Top Slope for Turning Tools.</b>&mdash;Aside from the
question of the shape of the cutting edge as viewed from the
top, there remains to be determined the amount of clearance
that the tool shall have, and also the slope (and its direction) of
the top of the tool. By the top is meant that surface against
which the chip bears while it is being severed. It may be stated,
in a general way, that the direction in which the top of the tool
should slope should be away from what is to be the <i>working
part</i> of the cutting edge. For example, the working edge of a
roughing tool <i>A</i> (<a href="#Fig_2_11">Fig. 11</a>), which is used for heavy cuts, would
be, practically speaking, between points <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, or, in other
words, most of the work would be done by this part of the cutting
edge; therefore the top should slope back from this part
of the edge. Obviously, a tool ground in this way will have
both a back and a side slope.</p>

<p>When most of the work is done on the point or nose of the
tool, as, for example, with the lathe finishing tool <i>C</i> which takes
light cuts, the slope should be straight back from the point or
cutting edge <i>a&mdash;b</i>. As the side tool shown in <a href="#Fig_2_10">Fig. 10</a> does its
cutting along the edge <i>a&mdash;b</i>, the top is given a slope back from
this edge as shown in the end view. This point should be
remembered, for when the top slopes in the right direction, less
power is required for cutting. Tools for certain classes of work,
such as thread tools, or those for turning brass or chilled iron,
are ground flat on top, that is, without back or side slope.</p>

<a name="Secnum_2_7" id="Secnum_2_7"></a><p><b>Clearance for the Cutting Edge.</b>&mdash;In order that the cutting
edge may work without interference, it must have clearance;
that is, the flank <i>f</i> (Fig. 10) must be ground to a certain angle <i>&alpha;</i>
so that it will not rub against the work and prevent the cutting
edge from entering the metal. This clearance should be just
enough to permit the tool to cut freely. A clearance angle of
eight or ten degrees is about right for lathe turning tools.</p>

<a name="Fig_2_12" id="Fig_2_12"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><div class="illobox450"><img src="images/075sm.png" alt="Illustrations showing how Effective Angles of Slope and Clearance change as Tool is raised or lowered" /></div>
<p class="caption750">Fig. 12. Illustrations showing how Effective Angles of Slope<br />and
Clearance change as Tool is raised or lowered</p>
</div>

<p>The back slope of a tool is measured from a line <i>A&mdash;B</i> which is
parallel to the shank, and the clearance angle, from a line <i>A&mdash;C</i>
at right angles to line <i>A&mdash;B</i>. These lines do not, however, always
occupy this position with relation to the tool shank when
the tool is in use. As shown to the left in <a href="#Fig_2_12">Fig. 12</a>, the base line
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_67" id="Pg_67">[67]</a></span>
<i>A&mdash;B</i> for a turning tool in use intersects with the point of the
tool and center of the work, while the line <i>A&mdash;C</i> remains at right
angles to the first. It will be seen, then, that by raising the
tool, as shown to the right, the <i>effective</i> clearance angle <i>&alpha;</i> will
be diminished, whereas lowering it, as shown by the dotted
lines, will have the opposite effect.</p>

<p>A turning tool for brass or other soft metal, particularly
where considerable hand manipulation is required, could advantageously
have a clearance of twelve or fourteen degrees,
as it would then be easier to feed the tool into the metal; but,
generally speaking, the clearance for turning tools should be
just enough to permit them to cut freely. Excessive clearance
weakens the cutting edge and may cause it to crumble under
the pressure of the cut.</p>

<a name="Secnum_2_8" id="Secnum_2_8"></a><p><b>Angle of Tool-point and Amount of Top Slope.</b>&mdash;The lip
angle or the angle of keenness <i>&delta;</i> (<a href="#Fig_2_10">Fig. 10</a>) is another important
consideration in connection with tool grinding, for it is upon
this angle that the efficiency of the tool largely depends. By
referring to the illustration it will be seen that this angle is
governed by the clearance and the slope <i>&beta;</i>, and as the clearance
remains practically the same, it is the slope which is varied to
meet different conditions. Now, the amount of slope a tool
should have depends on the work for which it is intended. If,
for example, a turning tool is to be used for roughing medium
or soft steel, it should have a back slope of about eight degrees
and a side slope ranging from fourteen to twenty degrees, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_68" id="Pg_68">[68]</a></span>
a tool for cutting very hard steel should have a back slope of
about five degrees and a side slope of nine degrees.</p>

<a name="Fig_2_13" id="Fig_2_13"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/076sm.jpg" alt="Blunt Tool for Turning Hard Steel, Tool-point Ground to give Keenness" />
<p class="caption750">Fig. 13. (A) Blunt Tool for Turning Hard Steel.<br />(B) Tool-point
Ground to give Keenness</p>
</div>

<p>The reason for decreasing the slope and thus increasing the
lip angle for harder metals is to give the necessary increased
strength to the cutting edge to prevent it from crumbling under
the pressure of the cut. The tool illustrated at <i>A</i>, <a href="#Fig_2_13">Fig. 13</a>, is
much stronger than it would be if ground as shown at <i>B</i>, as
the former is more blunt. If a tool ground as at <i>A</i>, however,
were used for cutting very soft steel, there would be a greater
chip pressure on the top and, consequently, a greater resistance
to cutting, than if a keener tool had been employed; furthermore
the cutting speed would have to be lower, which is of
even greater importance than the chip pressure; therefore, the
lip angle, as a general rule, should be as small as possible without
weakening the tool so that it cannot do the required work.
In order to secure a strong and well-supported cutting edge,
tools used for turning very hard metal, such as chilled rolls,
etc., are ground with practically no slope and with very little
clearance. Brass tools, while given considerable clearance, as
previously stated, are ground flat on top or without slope; this
is not done, however, to give strength to the cutting edge, but
rather to prevent the tool from gouging into the work, which it
is likely to do if the part being turned is at all flexible and the
tool has top slope.</p>

<p>Experiments conducted by Mr. F. W. Taylor to determine
the most efficient form for lathe roughing tools showed that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_69" id="Pg_69">[69]</a></span>
nearer the lip angle approached sixty-one degrees, the higher
the cutting speed. This, however, does not apply to tools for
turning cast iron, as the latter will work more efficiently with a
lip angle of about sixty-eight degrees. This is doubtless because
the chip pressure, when turning cast iron, comes closer
to the cutting edge which should, therefore, be more blunt to
withstand the abrasive action and heat. Of course, the foregoing
remarks concerning lip angles apply more particularly to
tools used for roughing.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/077sm.jpg" alt="Grinding the Top and Flank of a Turning Tool" />
<p class="caption750">Fig. 14. Grinding the Top and Flank of a Turning Tool</p>
</div>

<a name="Secnum_2_9" id="Secnum_2_9"></a><p><b>Grinding a Lathe Tool.</b>&mdash;The way a turning tool is held
while the top surface is being ground is shown to the left in
<a href="#Fig_2_14">Fig. 14</a>. By inclining the tool with the wheel face, it will be
seen that both the back and side slopes may be ground at the
same time. When grinding the flank of the tool it should be
held on the tool-rest of the emery wheel or grindstone, as shown
by the view to the right. In order to form a curved cutting
edge, the tool is turned about the face of the stone while it is
being ground. This rotary movement can be effected by supporting
the inner end of the tool with one hand while the shank
is moved to and fro with the other.</p>

<p>Often a tool which has been ground properly in the first place
is greatly misshapen after it has been sharpened a few times.
This is usually the result of attempts on the part of the workman
to re-sharpen it hurriedly; for example, it is easier to secure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_70" id="Pg_70">[70]</a></span>
a sharp edge on the turning tool shown to the left in <a href="#Fig_2_12">Fig. 12</a>, by
grinding the flank as indicated by the dotted line, than by
grinding the entire flank. The clearance is, however, reduced
and the lip angle changed.</p>

<p>There is great danger when grinding a tool of burning it or
drawing the temper from the fine cutting edge, and, aside from
the actual shape of the cutting end, this is the most important
point in connection with tool grinding. If a tool is pressed
hard against an emery or other abrasive wheel, even though the
latter has a copious supply of water, the temper will sometimes
be drawn. When grinding a flat surface, to avoid burning, the
tool should frequently be withdrawn from the stone so that the
cooling water (a copious supply of which should be provided)
can reach the surface being ground. A moderate pressure
should also be applied, as it is better to spend an extra minute
or two in grinding than to ruin the tool by burning, in an attempt
to sharpen it quickly. Of course, what has been said
about burning applies more particularly to carbon steel, but
even self-hardening steels are not improved by being over-heated
at the stone. In some shops, tools are ground to the
theoretically correct shape in special machines instead of by
hand. The sharpened tools are then kept in the tool-room and
are given out as they are needed.</p>

<a name="Secnum_2_10" id="Secnum_2_10"></a><p><b>Cutting Speeds and Feeds.</b>&mdash;The term cutting speed as applied
to turning operations is the speed in feet per minute of
the surface being turned, or, practically speaking, it is equivalent
to the length of a chip, in feet, which would be turned in
one minute. The term cutting speed should not be confused
with revolutions per minute, because the cutting speed depends
not only upon the speed of the work but also upon its diameter.
The feed of a tool is the amount it moves across the surface
being turned for each revolution; that is, when turning a cylindrical
piece, the feed is the amount that the tool moves sidewise
for each revolution of the work. Evidently the time required
for turning is governed largely by the cutting speed, the feed,
and the depth of the cut; therefore, these elements should be
carefully considered.</p>

a good grade of high-speed steel, properly ground and heat-treated.&mdash;From <span class="smcap">Machinery's Handbook</span>.</div>

<a name="Secnum_2_11" id="Secnum_2_11"></a><b>Average Cutting Speeds for Turning.</b>&mdash;The cutting speed is
governed principally by the hardness of the metal to be turned;
the kind of steel of which the turning tool is made; the shape
of the tool and its heat-treatment; the feed and depth of cut;
whether or not a cooling lubricant is used on the tool; the
power of the lathe and also its construction; hence it is impossible
to give any definite rule for determining either the
speed, feed, or depth of cut, because these must be varied to
suit existing conditions. A general idea of the speeds used in
ordinary machine shop practice may be obtained from the following
figures:</p>

<p>Ordinary machine steel is generally turned at a speed varying
between 45 and 65 feet per minute. For ordinary gray cast
iron, the speed usually varies from 40 to 50 feet per minute;
for annealed tool steel, from 25 to 35 feet per minute; for soft
yellow brass, from 150 to 200 feet per minute; for hard bronze,
from 35 to 80 feet per minute, the speed depending upon the
composition of the alloy. While these speeds correspond
closely to general practice, they can be exceeded for many
machining operations.</p>

<p>The most economical speeds for a given feed and depth of
cut, as determined by the experiments conducted by Mr. F. W.
Taylor, are given in the table, &#8220;<a href="#Fnanchor_1">Cutting Speeds and Feeds for
Turning Tools</a>.&#8221; The speeds given in this table represent results
obtained with tools made of a good grade of high-speed
steel properly heat-treated and correctly ground. It will be
noted that the cutting speed is much slower for cast iron than
for steel. Cast iron is cut with less pressure or resistance than
soft steel, but the slower speed required for cast iron is probably
due to the fact that the pressure of the chip is concentrated
closer to the cutting edge, combined with the fact that cast
iron wears the tool faster than steel. The speeds given are
higher than those ordinarily used, and, in many cases, a slower
rate would be necessary to prevent chattering or because of
some other limiting condition.</p>

<a name="Secnum_2_12" id="Secnum_2_12"></a><p><b>Factors which limit the Cutting Speed.</b>&mdash;It is the durability
of the turning tool or the length of time that it will turn effectively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_73" id="Pg_73">[73]</a></span>
without grinding, that limits the cutting speed; and the
hardness of the metal being turned combined with the quality
of the tool are the two factors which largely govern the time
that a tool can be used before grinding is necessary. The cutting
speed for very soft steel or cast iron can be three or four
times faster than the speed for hard steel or hard castings, but
whether the material is hard or soft, the kind and quality of
the tool used must also be considered, as the speed for a tool
made of ordinary carbon steel will have to be much slower than
for a tool made of modern &#8220;high-speed&#8221; steel.</p>

<p>When the cutting speed is too high, even though high-speed
steel is used, the point of the tool is softened to such an extent
by the heat resulting from the pressure and friction of the chip,
that the cutting edge is ruined in too short a time. On the
other hand, when the speed is too slow, the heat generated is
so slight as to have little effect and the tool point is dulled by
being slowly worn or ground away by the action of the chip.
While a tool operating at such a low speed can be used a comparatively
long time without re-sharpening, this advantage is
more than offset by the fact that too much time is required for
removing a given amount of metal when the work is revolving
so slowly.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the speed should be such that a fair
amount of work can be done before the tool requires re-grinding.
Evidently, it would not pay to grind a tool every few
minutes in order to maintain a high cutting speed; neither
would it be economical to use a very slow speed and waste considerable
time in turning, just to save the few minutes required
for grinding. For example, if a number of roughing cuts had
to be taken over a heavy rod or shaft, time might be saved by
running at such a speed that the tool would have to be sharpened
(or be replaced by a tool previously sharpened) when it had
traversed half-way across the work; that is, the time required
for sharpening or changing the tool would be short as compared
with the gain effected by the higher work speed. On the
other hand, it might be more economical to run a little slower
and take a continuous cut across the work with one tool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_74" id="Pg_74">[74]</a></span>The experiments of Mr. Taylor led to the conclusion that, as
a rule, it is not economical to use roughing tools at a speed so
slow as to cause them to last more than 1<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub> hour without being
re-ground; hence the speeds given in the <a href="#Fnanchor_1">table</a> previously referred
to are based upon this length of time between grindings.
Sometimes the work speed cannot be as high as the tool will
permit, because of the chattering that often results when the
lathe is old and not massive enough to absorb the vibrations, or
when there is unnecessary play in the working parts. The shape
of the tool used also affects the work speed, and as there are so
many things to be considered, the proper cutting speed is best
determined by experiment.</p>

<a name="Secnum_2_13" id="Secnum_2_13"></a><p><b>Rules for Calculating Cutting Speeds.</b>&mdash;The number of revolutions
required to give any desired cutting speed can be found
by multiplying the cutting speed, in feet per minute, by 12 and
dividing the product by the circumference of the work in inches.
Expressing this as a formula we have</p>

<div class="formula center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Formula 74_1">
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><i>C</i>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;12</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>&nbsp;R&nbsp;</i></td><td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><i>&pi;d</i></td></tr>

<tr><td><i>&nbsp;d&nbsp;</i></td><td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;the diameter in inches.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>For example if a cutting speed of 60 feet per minute is wanted
and the diameter of the work is 5 inches, the required speed
would be found as follows:</p>

<div class="formula center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Formula 74_2">
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>60&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;12</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>3.1416&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;5</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>If the diameter is simply multiplied by 3 and the fractional
part is omitted, the calculation can easily be made, and the result
will be close enough for practical purposes. In case the cutting
speed, for a given number of revolutions and diameter, is wanted,
the following formula can be used:</p>

</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_75" id="Pg_75">[75]</a></span>Machinists who operate lathes do not know, ordinarily, what
cutting speeds, in feet per minute, are used for different classes
of work, but are guided entirely by past experience.</p>

<a name="Secnum_2_14" id="Secnum_2_14"></a><p><b>Feed of Tool and Depth of Cut.</b>&mdash;The amount of feed and
depth of cut also vary like the cutting speed, for different conditions.
When turning soft machine steel the feed under
ordinary conditions would vary between <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub
class="denom">32</sub> and <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">16</sub> inch per
revolution. For turning soft cast iron the feed might be increased
to from <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">16</sub> to <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub
class="denom">8</sub> inch per revolution. These feeds
apply to fairly deep roughing cuts. Coarser feeds might be
used in many cases especially when turning large rigid parts in
a powerful lathe. The depth of a roughing cut in machine
steel might vary from <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">8</sub> to <sup class="enum">3</sup>/<sub
class="denom">8</sub> inch, and in cast iron from <sup class="enum">3</sup>/<sub class="denom">16</sub> to
<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub> inch. These figures are intended simply to give the reader a
general idea of feeds and cuts that are feasible under average
conditions.</p>

<p>Ordinarily coarser feeds and a greater depth of cut can be
used for cast iron than for soft steel, because cast iron offers
less resistance to turning, but in any case, with a given depth of
cut, metal can be removed more quickly by using a coarse feed
and the necessary slower speed, than by using a fine feed and
the higher speed which is possible when the feed is reduced.
When the turning operation is simply to remove metal, the feed
should be coarse, and the cut as deep as practicable. Sometimes
the cut must be comparatively light, either because the
work is too fragile and springy to withstand the strain of a
heavy cut, or the lathe has not sufficient pulling power. The
difficulty with light slender work is that a heavy cut may cause
the part being turned to bend under the strain, thus causing the
tool to gouge in, which would probably result in spoiling the
work. Steadyrests can often be used to prevent flexible parts
from springing, as previously explained, but there are many
kinds of light work to which the steadyrest cannot be applied
to advantage.</p>

<a name="Fig_2_15" id="Fig_2_15"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/084sm.jpg" alt="Roughing Cut&mdash;Light Finishing Cut and Coarse Feed" />
<p class="caption750">Fig. 15. Roughing Cut&mdash;Light Finishing Cut and Coarse Feed</p>
</div>

<p>The amount of feed to use for a finishing cut might, properly, be
either fine or coarse. Ordinarily, fine feeds are used for finishing
steel, especially if the work is at all flexible, whereas finishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_76" id="Pg_76">[76]</a></span>
cuts in cast iron are often accompanied by a coarse feed.
<a href="#Fig_2_15">Fig. 15</a> illustrates the feeds that are often used when turning
cast iron. The view to the left shows a deep roughing cut and
the one to the right, a finishing cut. By using a broad flat
cutting edge set parallel to the tool's travel, and a coarse feed
for finishing, a smooth cut can be taken in a comparatively
short time. Castings which are close to the finished size in
the rough can often be finished to advantage by taking a single
cut with a broad tool, provided the work is sufficiently rigid.
It is not always practicable to use these broad tools and coarse
feeds, as they sometimes cause chattering, and when used on
steel, a broad tool tends to gouge or &#8220;dig in&#8221; unless the part
being turned is rigid. Heavy steel parts, however, are sometimes
finished in this way. The modern method of finishing
many steel parts is to simply rough them out in a lathe to
within, say, <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">32</sub> inch of the required diameter and take the finishing
cut in a cylindrical grinding machine.</p>

<a name="Secnum_2_15" id="Secnum_2_15"></a><p><b>Effect of Lubricant on Cutting Speed.</b>&mdash;When turning iron
or steel a higher cutting speed can be used, if a stream of soda
water or other cooling lubricant falls upon the chip at the point
where it is being removed by the tool. In fact, experiments
have shown that the cutting speed, when using a large stream of
cooling water and a high-speed steel tool, can be about 40 percent
higher than when turning dry or without a cooling lubricant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_77" id="Pg_77">[77]</a></span>
For ordinary carbon steel tools, the gain was about
25 per cent. The most satisfactory results were obtained from
a stream falling at a rather slow velocity but in large volume.
The gain in cutting speed, by the use of soda water or other
suitable fluids, was found to be practically the same for all
qualities of steel from the softest to the hardest.</p>

<p>Cast iron is usually turned dry or without a cutting lubricant.
Experiments, however, made to determine the effect of applying
a heavy stream of cooling water to a tool turning cast iron,
showed the following results: Cutting speed without water, 47
feet per minute; cutting speed with a heavy stream of water,
nearly 54 feet per minute; increase in speed, 15 per cent. The
dirt caused by mixing the fine cast-iron turnings with a cutting
lubricant is an objectionable feature which, in the opinion of
many, more than offsets the increase in cutting speed that
might be obtained.</p>

<p>Turret lathes and automatic turning machines are equipped
with a pump and piping for supplying cooling lubricant to the
tools in a continuous stream. Engine lathes used for general
work, however, are rarely provided with such equipment and
a lubricant, when used, is often supplied by a can mounted at
the rear of the carriage, having a spout which extends above the
tool. Owing to the inconvenience in using a lubricant on an
engine lathe, steel, as well as cast iron, is often turned dry
especially when the work is small and the cuts light and comparatively
short.</p>

<a name="Secnum_2_16" id="Secnum_2_16"></a><p><b>Lubricants Used for Turning.</b>&mdash;A good grade of lard oil is
an excellent lubricant for use when turning steel or wrought
iron and it is extensively used on automatic screw machines,
especially those which operate on comparatively small work.
For some classes of work, especially when high-cutting speeds
are used, lard oil is not as satisfactory as soda water or some of
the commercial lubricants, because the oil is more sluggish and
does not penetrate to the cutting point with sufficient rapidity.
Many lubricants which are cheaper than oil are extensively
used on &#8220;automatics&#8221; for general machining operations. These
usually consist of a mixture of sal-soda (carbonate of soda) and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_78" id="Pg_78">[78]</a></span>
water, to which is added some ingredient such as lard oil or soft
soap to thicken or give body to the lubricant.</p>

<p>A cheap lubricant for turning, milling, etc., and one that has
been extensively used, is made in the following proportions:
1 pound of sal-soda, 1 quart of lard oil, 1 quart of soft soap,
and enough water to make 10 or 12 gallons. This mixture is
boiled for one-half hour, preferably by passing a steam coil
through it. If the solution should have an objectionable odor,
this can be eliminated by adding 2 pounds of unslaked lime. The
soap and soda in this solution improve the lubricating quality
and also prevent the surfaces from rusting. For turning and
threading operations, plain milling, deep-hole drilling, etc., a
mixture of equal parts of lard oil and paraffin oil will be found
very satisfactory, the paraffin being added to lessen the expense.</p>

<p>Brass or bronze is usually machined dry, although lard oil is
sometimes used for automatic screw machine work. Babbitt
metal is also worked dry, ordinarily, although kerosene or
turpentine is sometimes used when boring or reaming. If
babbitt is bored dry, balls of metal tend to form on the tool
point and score the work. Milk is generally considered the best
lubricant for machining copper. A mixture of lard oil and
turpentine is also used for copper. For aluminum, the following
lubricants can be used: Kerosene, a mixture of kerosene
and gasoline, soap-water, or &#8220;aqualine&#8221; one part, water 20
parts.</p>

<a name="Secnum_2_17" id="Secnum_2_17"></a><p><b>Lard Oil as a Cutting Lubricant.</b>&mdash;After being used for a considerable
time, lard oil seems to lose some of its good qualities
as a cooling compound. There are several reasons for this:
Some manufacturers use the same oil over and over again on
different materials, such as brass, steel, etc. This is objectionable,
for when lard oil has been used on brass it is practically
impossible to get the fine dust separated from it in a centrifugal
separator. When this impure oil is used on steel, especially
where high-speed steels are employed, it does not give satisfactory
results, owing to the fact that when the cutting tool
becomes dull, the small brass particles &#8220;freeze&#8221; to the cutting
tool and thus produce rough work. The best results are obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_79" id="Pg_79">[79]</a></span>
from lard oil by keeping it thin, and by using it on the
same materials&mdash;that is, not transferring the oil from a machine
in which brass is being cut to one where it would be employed
on steel. If the oil is always used on the same class of material,
it will not lose any of its good qualities.</p>

<p>Prime lard oil is nearly colorless, having a pale yellow or
greenish tinge. The solidifying point and other characteristics
of the oil depend upon the temperature at which it was expressed,
winter-pressed lard oil containing less solid constituents of the
lard than that expressed in warm weather. The specific gravity
should not exceed 0.916; it is sometimes increased by adulterants,
such as cotton-seed and maize oils.</p>

<h3>TAPER TURNING&mdash;SPECIAL OPERATIONS&mdash;FITTING</h3>
<hr class="c05" />

<p>It is often necessary, in connection with lathe work, to turn
parts tapering instead of straight or cylindrical. If the work is
mounted between the centers, one method of turning a taper is
to set the tailstock center out of alignment with the headstock
center. When both of these centers are in line, the movement
of the tool is parallel to the axis of the work and, consequently, a
cylindrical surface is produced; but if the tailstock <i>h<sub>1</sub></i> is set out
of alignment, as shown in <a href="#Fig_3_1">Fig. 1</a>, the work will then be turned
tapering as the tool is traversed from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>, because the axis
<i>x&mdash;x</i> is at an angle with the movement of the tool. Furthermore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_81" id="Pg_81">[81]</a></span>
the amount of taper or the difference between the diameters
at the ends for a given length, will depend on how much
center <i>h<sub>1</sub></i> is set over from the central position.</p>

<a name="Fig_3_1" id="Fig_3_1"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><div class="illobox450"><img src="images/088sm.png" alt="Taper Turning by the Offset-center Method" /></div>
<p class="caption750">Fig. 1. Taper Turning by the Offset-center Method</p>
</div>

<p>The amount of taper is usually given on drawings in inches
per foot, or the difference in the diameter at points twelve
inches apart. For example, the taper of the piece shown at <i>A</i>,
<a href="#Fig_3_2">Fig. 2</a>, is 1 inch per foot, as the length of the tapering surface
is just twelve inches and the difference between the diameters
at the ends is 1 inch. The conical roller shown at <i>B</i> has a total
length of 9 inches and a tapering surface 6 inches long, and in
this case the taper per foot is also 1 inch, there being a difference
of <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub> inch in a length of 6 inches or 1 inch in twice that
length. When the taper per foot is known, the amount that
the tailstock center should be set over for turning that taper
can easily be estimated, but it should be remembered that the
setting obtained in this way is not absolutely correct, and is
only intended to locate the center approximately. When a
taper needs to be at all accurate, it is tested with a gage, or by
other means, after taking a trial cut, as will be explained later,
and the tailstock center is readjusted accordingly. There are
also more accurate methods of setting the center, than by figuring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_82" id="Pg_82">[82]</a></span>
the amount of offset, but as the latter is often convenient
this will be referred to first.</p>

</div>

<a name="Secnum_3_1" id="Secnum_3_1"></a><p><b>Setting Tailstock Center for Taper Turning.</b>&mdash;Suppose the
tailstock center is to be set for turning part <i>C</i>, <a href="#Fig_3_2">Fig. 2</a>, to a taper
of approximately 1 inch per foot. In this case the center would
simply be moved toward the front of the machine <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub> inch, or
one-half the required taper per foot, because the total length
of the work happens to be just 12 inches. This setting, however,
would not be correct for all work requiring a taper of 1
inch per foot, as the adjustment depends not only on the <i>amount</i>
of the taper but on the <i>total length</i> of the piece.</p>

<a name="Fig_3_3" id="Fig_3_3"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/090sm.jpg" alt="Detail View of Lathe Tailstock" />
<p class="caption750">Fig. 3. Detail View of Lathe Tailstock</p>
</div>

<p>For example, the taper
roller <i>B</i> has a taper of
1 inch per foot, but the
center, in this case, would
be offset less than one-half
the taper per foot,
because the total length
is only 9 inches. For
lengths longer or shorter
than twelve inches, the
taper per inch should be
found first; this is then
multiplied by the <i>total</i> length of the work (not the length of the
taper) which gives the taper for that length, and one-half this
taper is the amount to set over the center. For example, the
taper per inch of part <i>B</i> equals 1 inch divided by 12 = <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">12</sub> inch.
The total length of 9 inches multiplied by <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">12</sub> inch =
<sup class="enum">3</sup>/<sub class="denom">4</sub> inch, and
<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub> of <sup class="enum">3</sup>/<sub class="denom">4</sub> =
<sup class="enum">3</sup>/<sub class="denom">8</sub>, which is the distance that the tailstock center should
be offset. In this example if the taper per foot were not known,
and only the diameters of the large and small ends of the tapered
part were given, the difference between these diameters should
first be found (2<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub> - 2 = <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub>);
this difference should then be divided
by the length of the taper (<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub>&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;6 = <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub
class="denom">12</sub> inch) to obtain the taper
per inch. The taper per inch times the <i>total</i> length represents
what the taper would be if it extended throughout the entire
length, and one-half of this equals the offset, which is <sup class="enum">3</sup>/<sub class="denom">8</sub> inch.</p>

<a name="Fig_3_4" id="Fig_3_4"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><div class="illobox450"><img src="images/091sm.png" alt="Taper Plug and Gage" /></div>
<p class="caption750">Fig. 4. Taper Plug and Gage</p>
</div>

<a name="Secnum_3_2" id="Secnum_3_2"></a><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_83" id="Pg_83">[83]</a></span>
<b>Example of Taper Turning.</b>&mdash;As a practical example of taper
turning let us assume that the piece A, <a href="#Fig_3_4">Fig. 4</a>, which has been
centered and rough-turned as shown, is to be made into a taper
plug, as indicated at <i>B</i>, to fit a ring gage as at <i>C</i>. If the required
taper is 1<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub> inch per foot and the total length is 8 inches,
the tailstock center would be offset <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub> inch.</p>

<p>To adjust the tailstock, the nuts <i>N</i> (<a href="#Fig_3_3">Fig. 3</a>) are first loosened
and then the upper part <i>A</i> is shifted sidewise by turning screw <i>S</i>.
Scales are provided on some tailstocks for measuring the amount
of this adjustment; if there is no scale, draw a line across the
movable and stationary parts <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, when the tailstock is
set for straight turning. The movement of the upper line in
relation to the lower will then show the offset, which can be
measured with a scale.</p>

<p>When the adjustment has been made, nuts <i>N</i> are tightened
and the part to be turned, with a dog attached, is placed between
the centers the same as for straight turning. The taper
end is then reduced by turning, but before it is near the finished
size, the work is removed and the taper tested by inserting it
in the gage. If it is much out, this can be felt, as the end that
is too small can be shaken in the hole. Suppose the plug did
not taper enough and only the small end came into contact with
the gage, as shown somewhat exaggerated at <i>D</i>; in that case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_84" id="Pg_84">[84]</a></span>
the center would be shifted a little more towards the front,
whereas if the taper were too steep, the adjustment would, of
course, be in the opposite direction. A light cut would then be
taken, to be followed by another test. If the plug should fit
the gage so well that there was no perceptible shake, it could be
tested more closely as follows: Draw three or four chalk lines
along the tapering surface, place the work in the gage and turn
it a few times. The chalk marks will then show whether the
taper of the plug corresponds to that of the gage; for example,
if the taper is too great, the marks will be rubbed out on the
large end, but if the taper is correct, the lines throughout their
length will be partially erased.</p>

<p>Another and more accurate method of testing tapers is to
apply a thin coat of Prussian-blue to one-half of the tapering
surface, in a lengthwise direction. The work is then inserted in
the hole or gage and turned to mark the bearing. If the taper
is correct, the bearing marks will be evenly distributed, whereas
if the taper is incorrect, they will appear at one end. Tapering
pieces that have to be driven tightly into a hole, such as a piston-rod,
can be tested by the location of the bearing marks produced
by actual contact.</p>

<p>After the taper is found to be correct, the plug is reduced in
size until it just enters the gage as at <i>C</i>. The final cut should
leave it slightly above the required size, so that a smooth surface<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_85" id="Pg_85">[85]</a></span>
can be obtained by filing. It should be mentioned that on
work of this kind, especially if great accuracy is required, the
final finish is often obtained by grinding in a regular grinding
machine, instead of by filing. When this method is employed,
a lathe is used merely to rough-turn the part close to size.</p>

<p>When the amount that the tailstock center should be offset
is determined by calculating, as in the foregoing example, it is
usually necessary to make slight changes afterward, and the
work should be tested before it is too near the finished size so
that in case one or more trial cuts are necessary, there will be
material enough to permit this. When there are a number of
tapered pieces to be turned to the same taper, the adjustment
of the tailstock center will have to be changed unless the total
length of each piece and the depth of the center holes are the
same in each case.</p>

<a name="Secnum_3_3" id="Secnum_3_3"></a><p><b>Setting the Tailstock Center with a Caliper Tool.</b>&mdash;Another
method of setting the tailstock center for taper turning is illustrated
in <a href="#Fig_3_5">Fig. 5</a>. The end of an engine piston-rod is to be made
tapering as at A and to dimensions <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>. It is first
turned with the centers in line as at <i>B</i>. The end <i>d</i> is reduced to
diameter <i>b</i> up to the beginning of the taper and it is then turned
to diameter <i>a</i> as far as the taper part <i>c</i> extends. The tailstock
center is next set over by guess and a caliper tool is clamped in
the toolpost. This tool, a side view of which is shown in <a href="#Fig_3_6">Fig. 6</a>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_86" id="Pg_86">[86]</a></span>
has a pointer <i>p</i> that is free to swing about pivot <i>r</i>, which should
be set to about the same height as the center of the work. The
tailstock center is adjusted until this pointer just touches the
work when in the positions shown by the full and dotted lines
at <i>C</i>, <a href="#Fig_3_5">Fig. 5</a>; that is, until the pointer makes contact at the beginning
and end of the taper part. The travel of the carriage
will then be parallel to a line <i>x&mdash;x</i>, representing the taper; consequently,
if a tool is started at the small end, as shown by the
dotted lines at <i>D</i>, with the nose just grazing the work, it will
also just graze it when fed to the extreme left as shown. Of
course, if the taper were at all steep, more than one cut would
be taken.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 7. Obtaining Tailstock Center Adjustment by use of Square</p>
</div>

<p>If these various operations are carefully performed, a fairly
accurate taper can be produced. The straight end <i>d</i> is reduced
to size after the tail-center is set back to the central
position. Some mechanics turn notches or grooves at the beginning
and end of the tapering part, having diameters equal to
the largest and smallest part of the taper; the work is then set
by these grooves with a caliper tool. The advantage of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_87" id="Pg_87">[87]</a></span>
first method is that most of the metal is removed while the
centers are in alignment.</p>

<a name="Secnum_3_4" id="Secnum_3_4"></a><p><b>Setting the Tailstock Center with a Square.</b>&mdash;Still another
method of adjusting the tailstock for taper turning, which is
very simple and eliminates all figuring, is as follows: The part
to be made tapering is first turned cylindrical or straight for
3 or 4 inches of its length, after the ends have been properly
centered and faced square. The work is then removed and the
tailstock is shifted along the bed until the distance <i>a&mdash;b</i> between
the extreme points of the centers is exactly 1 foot. The center
is next offset a distance <i>b&mdash;c</i> equal to one-half the required
taper per foot, after which a parallel strip <i>D</i>, having true sides,
is clamped in the toolpost. Part <i>D</i> is then set at right angles
to a line passing from one center point to the other. This can
be done conveniently by holding a 1-foot square (preferably with
a sliding head) against one side of <i>D</i> and adjusting the latter in
the toolpost until edge <i>E</i> of the square blade is exactly in line
with both center points. After part <i>D</i> is set, it should be
clamped carefully to prevent changing the position. The angle
between the side of <i>D</i> and an imaginary line which is perpendicular
to axis <i>a&mdash;b</i> is now equal to one-half the angle of the
required taper.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_88" id="Pg_88">[88]</a></span>The axis of the part to be turned should be set parallel with
line <i>E</i>, which can be done by setting the cylindrical surface
which was previously finished, at right angles to the side of <i>D</i>.
In order to do this the work is first placed between centers, the
tailstock being shifted along the bed if necessary; the tail-center
is then adjusted laterally until the finished cylindrical
surface is square with the side of <i>D</i>. A small try-square can be
used for testing
the position of the
work, as indicated
in <a href="#Fig_3_8">Fig. 8</a>. If the
length of the work
is less than 1 foot,
it will be necessary
to move the
center toward the
rear of the machine,
and if the
length is greater
than 1 foot, the
adjustment is, of
course, in the opposite
direction.</p>

<a name="Secnum_3_5" id="Secnum_3_5"></a><p><b>The Taper Attachment.</b>&mdash;Turning
tapers by
setting over the
tailstock center has some objectionable features. When the
lathe centers are not in alignment, as when set for taper turning,
they bear unevenly in the work centers because the axis
of the work is at an angle with them; this causes the work
centers to wear unevenly and results in inaccuracy. Furthermore,
the adjustment of the tailstock center must be changed
when turning duplicate tapers, unless the length of each piece
and the depth of the center holes are the same. To overcome
these objections, many modern lathes are equipped with a
special device for turning tapers, known as a taper attachment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_89" id="Pg_89">[89]</a></span>
which permits the lathe centers to be kept in alignment, as
for cylindrical turning, and enables more accurate work to be
done.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/096sm.jpg" alt="A Lathe Taper Attachment" />
<p class="caption750">Fig. 9. A Lathe Taper Attachment</p>
</div>

<p>Taper attachments, like lathes, vary some in their construction,
but all operate on the same principle. An improved form
of taper attachment is illustrated in <a href="#Fig_3_9">Figs. 9</a> and <a href="#Fig_3_10">10</a>. <a href="#Fig_3_9">Fig. 9</a>
shows a plan view of a lathe carriage with an attachment
fitted to it, and <a href="#Fig_3_10">Fig. 10</a> a sectional view. This attachment has
an arm <i>A</i> on which is mounted a slide <i>S</i> that can be turned
about a central pivot by adjusting screw <i>D</i>. The arm <i>A</i> is
supported by, and is free to slide on, a bracket <i>B</i> (see also sectional
view) that is fastened to the carriage, and on one end of
the arm there is a clamp <i>C</i> that is attached to the lathe bed
when turning tapers. On the slide <i>S</i> there is a shoe <i>F</i> that is
connected to bar <i>E</i> which passes beneath the toolslide. The
rear end of the cross-feed screw is connected to this bar, and
the latter is clamped to the toolslide when the attachment is
in use.</p>

<a name="Fig_3_10" id="Fig_3_10"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/097sm.jpg" alt="Sectional View of Taper Attachment" />
<p class="caption750">Fig. 10. Sectional View of Taper Attachment</p>
</div>

<p>When a taper is to be turned, the carriage is moved opposite
the taper part and clamp <i>C</i> is fastened to the bed; this holds
arm <i>A</i> and slide <i>S</i> stationary so that the carriage, with bracket
<i>B</i> and shoe <i>F</i>, can be moved with relation to the slide. If this
slide <i>S</i> is set at an angle, as shown, the shoe as it moves along
causes the toolslide and tool to move in or out, but if the slide
is set parallel to the carriage travel, the toolslide remains
stationary. Now if the tool, as it feeds lengthwise of the work,
is also gradually moved crosswise, it will turn a taper, and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_90" id="Pg_90">[90]</a></span>
this crosswise movement is caused by the angularity of slide <i>S</i>,
different tapers are obtained by setting the slide to different
positions.</p>

<p>By means of a graduated scale <i>G</i> at the end of slide <i>S</i>, the
taper that will be obtained for any angular position of the slide
is shown. On some attachments there are two sets of graduations,
one giving the taper in inches per foot and the other in
degrees. While tapers are ordinarily given in inches per foot
on drawings, sometimes the taper is given in degrees instead.
The attachment is set for turning tapers by adjusting slide <i>S</i>
until pointer <i>p</i> is opposite the division or fractional part of a
division representing the taper. The whole divisions on the
scale represent taper in inches per foot, and by means of the
sub-divisions, the slide can be set for turning fractional parts of
an inch per foot. When slide <i>S</i> is properly set, it is clamped to
arm <i>A</i> by the nuts <i>N</i>. Bar <i>E</i> is also clamped to the toolslide by
bolt <i>H</i>, as previously stated. The attachment is disconnected
for straight turning by simply loosening clamp <i>C</i> and the bolt <i>H</i>.</p>

<a name="Secnum_3_6" id="Secnum_3_6"></a><p><b>Application of Taper Attachment.</b>&mdash;Practical examples of
lathe work, which illustrate the use of the taper attachment,
are shown in <a href="#Fig_3_11">Figs. 11</a> and <a href="#Fig_3_12">12</a>. <a href="#Fig_3_11">Fig. 11</a> shows how a taper hole
is bored in an engine piston-head, preparatory to reaming.
The casting must be held either in a chuck <i>C</i> or on a faceplate
if too large for the chuck. The side of the casting (after it has
been &#8220;chucked&#8221;) should run true, and also the circumference,
unless the cored hole for the rod is considerably out of center,
in which case the work should be shifted to divide the error.
The side of the casting for a short space around the hole is faced
true with a round nose turning tool, after which the rough-cored
hole is bored with an ordinary boring tool <i>t</i>, and then it is
finished with a reamer to exactly the right size and taper.</p>

<a name="Fig_3_12" id="Fig_3_12"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><div class="illobox450"><img src="images/101sm.png" alt="Taper Attachment Set for Turning Taper End of Piston-rod" /></div>
<p class="caption750">Fig. 12. Taper Attachment Set for Turning Taper End of Piston-rod</p>
</div>

<p>This particular taper attachment is set to whatever taper is
given on the drawing, by loosening nuts <i>N</i> and turning slide <i>S</i>
until pointer <i>P</i> is opposite that division on the scale which represents
the taper. The attachment is then ready, after bolt <i>H</i>
and nuts <i>N</i> are tightened, and clamp <i>C</i> is fastened to the lathe
bed. The hole is bored just as though it were straight, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_91" id="Pg_91">[91]</a></span>
as the carriage advances, the tool is gradually moved inward by
the attachment. If the lathe did not have a taper attachment,
the taper hole could be bored by using the compound rest.</p>

<p>The hole should be bored slightly less than the finish size to
allow for reaming. When a reamer is used in the lathe, the
outer end is supported by the tailstock center and should have
a deep center-hole. The lathe is run very slowly for reaming
and the reamer is fed into the work by feeding out the tailstock
spindle. The reamer can be kept from revolving, either by attaching
a heavy dog to the end or, if the end is squared, by the
use of a wrench long enough to rest against the lathe carriage.
A common method is to clamp a dog to the reamer shank, and
then place the tool-rest beneath it to prevent rotation. If the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_92" id="Pg_92">[92]</a></span>
shank of a tool is clamped to the toolpost so that the dog rests
against it, the reamer will be prevented from slipping off the
center as it tends to do; with this arrangement, the carriage is
gradually moved along as the tailstock spindle is fed outward.
Some reamers are provided with stop-collars which come against
the finished side of the casting when the hole has been reamed
to size.</p>

<p>After the reaming operation, the casting is removed from the
chuck and a taper mandrel is driven into the hole for turning
the outside of the piston. This mandrel should run true on its
centers, as otherwise the outside surface of the piston will not
be true with the bored hole. The driving dog, especially for
large work of this kind, should be heavy and stiff, because light
flexible clamps or dogs vibrate and frequently cause chattering.
For such heavy work it is also preferable to drive at two points
on opposite sides of the faceplate, but the driving pins should
be carefully adjusted to secure a uniform bearing on both sides.</p>

<p>The foregoing method of machining a piston is one that
would ordinarily be followed when using a standard engine
lathe, and it would, perhaps, be as economical as any if only one
piston were being made; but where such work is done in large
quantities, time could be saved by proceeding in a different
way. For example, the boring and reaming operation could be
performed much faster in a turret lathe, which is a type designed
for just such work, but a turret lathe cannot be used for
as great a variety of turning operations as a lathe of the regular
type. There are also many other classes of work that can be
turned more quickly in special types of machines, but as more
or less time is required for arranging these special machines and
often special tools have to be made, the ordinary lathe is frequently
indispensable when only a few parts are needed; in
addition, it is better adapted to some turning operations than
any other machine.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_3_12">Fig. 12</a> illustrates how a taper attachment would be used for
turning the taper fitting for the crosshead end of an engine
piston-rod. Even though this taper corresponds to the taper of
the hole in the piston, slide <i>S</i> would have to be reset to the corresponding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_93" id="Pg_93">[93]</a></span>
division on the opposite side of the central zero
mark, because the taper of the hole decreased in size during the
boring operation, whereas the rod is smallest at the beginning
of the cut, so that the tool must move outward rather than inward
as it advances. The taper part is turned practically the
same as a cylindrical part; that is, the power feed is used and,
as the carriage moves along the bed, the tool is gradually moved
outward by the taper attachment.</p>

<p>If the rod is being fitted directly to the crosshead (as is usually
the case), the approximate size of the small end of the taper
could be determined by calipering, the calipers being set to the
size of the hole at a distance from the shoulder or face side of
the crosshead, equal to the length of the taper fitting on the
rod. If the crosshead were bored originally to fit a standard
plug gage, the taper on the rod could be turned with reference
to this gage, but, whatever the method, the taper should be
tested before turning too close to the finished size. The test is
made by removing the rod from the lathe and driving it tightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_94" id="Pg_94">[94]</a></span>
into the crosshead. This shows how near the taper is to size,
and when the rod is driven out, the bearing marks show whether
the taper is exactly right or not. If the rod could be driven in
until the shoulder is, say, <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">8</sub> inch from the crosshead face, it
would then be near enough to finish to size by filing. When
filing, the lathe is run much faster than for turning, and most
of the filing should be done where the bearing marks are the
heaviest, to distribute the bearing throughout the length of the
taper. Care should be taken when driving the rod in or out,
to protect the center-holes in the ends by using a &#8220;soft&#8221; hammer
or holding a piece of soft metal against the driving end.</p>

<p>After the crosshead end is finished, the rod is reversed in the
lathe for turning the piston end. The dog is clamped to the
finished end, preferably over a piece of sheet copper to prevent
the surface from being marred. When turning this end, either
the piston reamer or the finished hole in the piston can be calipered.
The size and angle of the taper are tested by driving the
rod into the piston, and the end should be fitted so that by
driving tightly, the shoulder will just come up against the
finished face of the piston. When the taper is finished, the attachment
is disengaged and a finishing cut is taken over the
body of the rod, unless it is to be finished by grinding, which is
the modern and most economical method.</p>

<a name="Secnum_3_7" id="Secnum_3_7"></a><p><b>Height of Tool when Turning Tapers.</b>&mdash;The cutting edge of
the tool, when turning tapers, should be at the same height as
the center or axis of the work, whether an attachment is used or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_95" id="Pg_95">[95]</a></span>
not. The importance of this will be apparent by referring to
<a href="#Fig_3_13">Fig. 13</a>. To turn the taper shown, the tool <i>T</i> would be moved
back a distance <i>x</i> (assuming that an attachment is used) while
traversing the length <i>l</i>. As an illustration, if the tool could
be placed as high as point <i>a</i>, the setting of the attachment remaining
as before, the tool would again move back a distance <i>x</i>,
while traversing a distance <i>l</i>, but the large end would be under-sized
(as shown by the dotted line) if the diameters of the small
ends were the same in each case. Of course, if the tool point
were only slightly above or below the center, the resulting error
would also be small. The tool can easily be set central by comparing
the height of the cutting edge at the point of the tool with
one of the lathe centers before placing the work in the lathe.</p>

<a name="Secnum_3_8" id="Secnum_3_8"></a><p><b>Taper Turning with the Compound Rest.</b>&mdash;The amount of
taper that can be turned by setting over the tailstock center
and by the taper attachment is limited, as the centers can
only be offset a certain distance, and the slide <i>S</i> (<a href="#Fig_3_9">Fig. 9</a>) of the
attachment cannot be swiveled beyond a certain position. For
steep tapers, the compound rest <i>E</i> is swiveled to the required<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_96" id="Pg_96">[96]</a></span>
angle and used as indicated in <a href="#Fig_3_14">Fig. 14</a>, which shows a plan view
of a rest set for turning the valve <i>V</i>. This compound rest is an
upper slide mounted on the lower or main cross-slide <i>D</i>, and it
can be turned to any angular position so that the tool, which
ordinarily is moved either lengthwise or crosswise of the bed,
can be fed at an angle. The base of the compound rest is
graduated in degrees and the position of these graduations
shows to what angle the upper slide is set. Suppose the seat of
valve <i>V</i> is to be turned to an angle of 45 degrees with the axis
or center, as shown on the drawing at <i>A</i>, <a href="#Fig_3_15">Fig. 15</a>. To set the
compound rest, nuts <i>n</i> on either side, which hold it rigidly to
the lower slide, are first loosened and the slide is then turned
until the 45-degree graduation is exactly opposite the zero line;
the slide is then tightened in this position. A cut is next taken
across the valve by operating handle <i>w</i> and feeding the tool in
the direction of the arrow.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 15. Example of Taper Work Turned by using Compound Rest</p>
</div>

<p>In this particular instance the compound rest is set to the
same angle given on the drawing, but this is not always the
case. If the draftsman had given the included angle of 90
degrees, as shown at <i>B</i>, which would be another way of expressing
it, the setting of the compound rest would, of course,
be the same as before, or to 45 degrees, but the number of degrees
marked on the drawing does not correspond with the angle
to which the rest must be set. As another illustration, suppose
the valve were to be turned to an angle of 30 degrees with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_97" id="Pg_97">[97]</a></span>
axis as shown at <i>C</i>. In this case the compound rest would not
be set to 30 degrees but to 60 degrees, because in order to turn
the work to an angle of 30 degrees, the rest must be 60 degrees
from its zero position, as shown. From this it will be seen
that the number of degrees marked on the drawing does not
necessarily correspond to the angle to which the rest must be
set, as the graduations on the rest show the number of degrees
that it is moved from its zero position, which corresponds to
the line <i>a&mdash;b</i>. The angle to which the compound rest should be
set can be found, when the drawing is marked as at <i>A</i> or <i>C</i>,
by subtracting the angle given from 90 degrees. When the included
angle is given, as at <i>B</i>, subtract one-half the included
angle from 90 degrees to obtain the required setting. Of course,
when using a compound rest, the lathe centers are set in line as
for straight turning, as otherwise the angle will be incorrect.</p>

accuracy is required in the measurement of angles, or when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_98" id="Pg_98">[98]</a></span>
originating tapers, disks are commonly used. The principle of
the disk method of taper measurement is that if two disks of
unequal diameters are placed either in contact or a certain distance
apart, lines tangent to their peripheries will represent an
angle or taper, the degree of which depends upon the diameters
of the two disks and the distance between them. The gage
shown in <a href="#Fig_3_16">Fig. 16</a>, which is a form commonly used for originating
tapers or measuring angles accurately, is set by means of disks.
This gage consists of two adjustable straight-edges <i>A</i> and <i>A<sub>1</sub></i>,
which are in contact with disks <i>B</i> and <i>B<sub>1</sub></i>. The angle <i>&alpha;</i> or the
taper between the straight-edges depends, of course, upon the
diameters of the disks and the center distance <i>C</i>, and as these
three dimensions can be measured accurately, it is possible to
set the gage to a given angle within very close limits. Moreover,
if a record of the three dimensions is kept, the exact setting
of the gage can be reproduced quickly at any time. The following
rules may be used for adjusting a gage of this type.</p>

by use of Test Indicator</p>
</div>

<a name="Secnum_3_14" id="Secnum_3_14"></a><p><b>Use of the Center Indicator.&mdash;</b>The center test indicator is
used for setting a center-punch mark, the position of which
corresponds with the center or axis of the hole to be bored, in
alignment with the axis of the lathe spindle. To illustrate, if
two holes are to be bored, say 5 inches apart, small punch
marks having that center-to-center distance would be laid out
as accurately as possible. One of these marks would then be
set central with the lathe spindle by using a center test indicator
as shown in <a href="#Fig_3_17">Fig. 17</a>. This indicator has a pointer <i>A</i> the
end of which is conical and enters the punch mark. The pointer
is held by shank <i>B</i> which is fastened in the toolpost. The
joint <i>C</i> by means of which the pointer is held to the shank is
universal; that is, it allows the pointer to move in any direction.
Now when the part being tested is rotated by running the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_101" id="Pg_101">[101]</a></span>
lathe, if the center-punch mark is not in line with the axes of
the lathe spindle, obviously the outer end of pointer <i>A</i> will
vibrate, and as joint <i>C</i> is quite close to the inner end, a very
slight error in the location of the center-punch mark will cause
a perceptible movement of the outer end, as indicated by the
dotted lines. When the work has been adjusted until the
pointer remains practically stationary, the punch mark is central,
and the hole is bored. The other center-punch mark is
then set in the same way for boring the second hole. The
accuracy of this method depends, of course, upon the location
of the center-punch marks. A still more accurate way of
setting parts for boring holes to a given center-to-center distance
is described in the following:</p>

<a name="Secnum_3_15" id="Secnum_3_15"></a><p><b>Locating Work by the Button Method.</b>&mdash;Among the different
methods employed by machinists and toolmakers for accurately
locating work such as jigs, etc., on the faceplate of a lathe, the
one most commonly used is known as the button method.
This scheme is so named because cylindrical bushings or buttons
are attached to the work in positions corresponding to the
holes to be bored, after which they are used in locating the
work. These buttons, which are ordinarily about <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub> inch in
diameter, are ground and lapped to the same size and the ends
squared. The diameter should, preferably, be such that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_102" id="Pg_102">[102]</a></span>
radius can be determined easily, and the hole through the center
should be about <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">8</sub> inch larger than the retaining screw, so that
the button can be shifted.</p>

<a name="Fig_3_18" id="Fig_3_18"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><div class="illobox450"><img src="images/109sm.png" alt="Jig Plate with Buttons attached, ready for Boring" /></div>
<p class="caption750">Fig. 18. Jig-plate with Buttons attached, ready for Boring</p>
</div>

<p>As an illustration of the practical application of the button
method, we shall consider, briefly, the way the holes would be
accurately machined in the jig-plate in <a href="#Fig_3_18">Fig. 18</a>. First the centers
of the seven holes should be laid off approximately correct
by the usual methods, after which small holes should be drilled
and tapped for the clamping screws <i>S</i>. After the buttons <i>B</i>
are clamped lightly in place, they are all set in correct relation
with each other and with the jig-plate. The proper location of
the buttons is very important as their positions largely determine
the accuracy of the work. A definite method of procedure
that would be applicable in all cases cannot, of course,
be given, as the nature of the work as well as the tools available
make it necessary to employ different methods.</p>

<p>In this particular case, the three buttons <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> should be
set first, beginning with the one in the center. As this central
hole must be 2.30 and 2.65 inches from the finished sides <i>A</i> and
<i>A<sub>1</sub></i>, respectively, the work is first placed on an accurate surface-plate
as shown; by resting it first on one of these sides and then
on the other, and measuring with a vernier height gage, the
central button can be accurately set. The buttons <i>a</i> and <i>c</i> are
also set to the correct height from side <i>A<sub>1</sub></i> by using the height
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_103" id="Pg_103">[103]</a></span>
gage, and in proper relation to the central button by using a
micrometer or a vernier caliper and measuring the over-all
dimension <i>x</i>. When measuring in this way, the diameter of one
button would be deducted to obtain the correct center-to-center
distance. After buttons <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> are set equidistant from
side A<sub>1</sub> and in proper relation to each other, the remaining
buttons should be set radially from the central button <i>b</i> and the
right distance apart. By having two micrometers or gages,
one set for the radial dimension <i>x</i> and the other for the chordal
distance <i>y</i>, the work may be done in a comparatively short
time.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 19. Setting a Button True Preparatory to Boring, by use of
Test Indicator</p>
</div>

<p>After the buttons have been tightened, all measurements
should be carefully checked; the work is then mounted on the
faceplate of the lathe, and one of the buttons, say <i>b</i>, is set true
by the use of a test indicator as shown in <a href="#Fig_3_19">Fig. 19</a>. When the
end of this indicator (which is one of a number of types on
the market) is brought into contact with the revolving button,
the vibration of the pointer <i>I</i> shows how much the button runs
out of true. When the pointer remains practically stationary,
thus showing that the button runs true, the latter should be
removed. The hole is then drilled nearly to the required size,
after which it is bored to the finish diameter. In a similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_104" id="Pg_104">[104]</a></span>
manner the other buttons are indicated and the holes bored,
one at a time. It is evident that if each button is correctly
located and set perfectly true in the lathe, the various holes
will be located at the required center-to-center dimensions
within very close limits.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_3_20">Fig. 20</a> shows how one of the buttons attached to a plate
in which three holes are to be bored is set true or concentric.
The particular indicator illustrated is of the dial type, any
error in the location of the button being shown by a hand over
a dial having graduations representing thousandths of an inch.
<a href="#Fig_3_21">Fig. 21</a> shows how the hole is drilled after the button is removed.
It will be noted that the drill is held in a chuck, the
taper shank of which fits into the tailstock spindle, this being
the method of holding small drills. After drilling, the hole is
bored as shown in <a href="#Fig_3_22">Fig. 22</a>. The boring tool should have a
keen edge to avoid springing, and if the work when clamped in
position, throws the faceplate out of balance, it is advisable to
restore the balance, before boring, by the use of a counter-weight,
because the lathe can be rotated quite rapidly when
boring such a small hole.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 23. Example of Work illustrating Accumulation of Errors</p>
</div>

<p>When doing precision work of this kind, the degree of accuracy
will depend upon the instruments used, the judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_105" id="Pg_105">[105]</a></span>
and skill of the workman and the care exercised. A good
general rule to follow when locating bushings or buttons is to
use the method which is the most direct and which requires
the least number of measurements. As an illustration of how
errors may accumulate, let us assume that seven holes are to
be bored in the jig-plate shown in <a href="#Fig_3_23">Fig. 23</a>, so that they are the
same distance from each other and in a straight line. The
buttons may be brought into alignment by the use of a straight-edge,
and to simplify matters, it will be taken for granted that
they have been ground and lapped to the same size. If the
diameter of the buttons is first determined by measuring with a
micrometer, and then this diameter is deducted from the center
distance <i>x</i>, the difference will be the distance <i>y</i> between adjacent
buttons. Now if a temporary gage is made to length <i>y</i>,
all the buttons can be set practically the same distance apart,
the error between any two adjacent ones being very slight.
If, however, the total length <i>z</i> over the end buttons is measured
by some accurate means, the chances are that this distance will
not equal six times dimension <i>x</i> plus the diameter of one button,
as it should, because even a very slight error in the gage for
distance <i>y</i> would gradually accumulate as each button was
set. If a micrometer were available that would span two of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_106" id="Pg_106">[106]</a></span>
the buttons, the measurements could be taken direct and greater
accuracy would doubtless be obtained. On work of this kind
where there are a number of holes that need to have accurate
over-all dimensions, the long measurements should first be
taken when setting the buttons, providing, of course, there are
proper facilities for so doing, and then the short ones. For example,
the end buttons in this case should first be set, then the
central one and finally those for the sub-divisions.</p>

</div>

<a name="Secnum_3_16" id="Secnum_3_16"></a><p><b>Eccentric Turning.</b>&mdash;When one cylindrical surface must be
turned eccentric to another, as when turning the eccentric of
a steam engine, an arbor having two sets of centers is commonly
used, as shown in <a href="#Fig_3_24">Fig. 24</a>. The distance <i>x</i> between the
centers must equal one-half the total &#8220;throw&#8221; or stroke of the
eccentric. The hub of the eccentric is turned upon the centers
<i>a&mdash;a</i>, and the tongued eccentric surface, upon the offset centers,
as indicated by the illustration. Sometimes eccentrics are
turned while held upon special fixtures attached to the faceplate.</p>

<p>When making an eccentric arbor, the offset center in each
end should be laid out upon radial lines which can be drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_107" id="Pg_107">[107]</a></span>
across the arbor ends by means of a surface gage. Each center
is then drilled and reamed to the same radius <i>x</i> as near as
possible. The uniformity of the distance <i>x</i> at each end is then
tested by placing the mandrel upon the offset centers and rotating
it, by hand, with a dial indicator in contact at first one end
and then the other. The amount of offset can also be tested
either by measuring from the point of a tool held in the toolpost,
or by setting the tool to just graze the mandrel at extreme
inner and outer positions, and noting the movement of
the cross-slide by referring to the dial gage of the cross-feed
screw.</p>

<a name="Secnum_3_17" id="Secnum_3_17"></a><p><b>Turning a Crankshaft in a Lathe.</b>&mdash;Another example of
eccentric turning is shown in <a href="#Fig_3_25">Fig. 25</a>. The operation is that of
turning the crank-pin of an engine crankshaft, in an ordinary
lathe. The main shaft is first rough-turned while the forging
revolves upon its centers <i>C</i> and <i>C<sub>1</sub></i> and the ends are turned to
fit closely the center-arms <i>A</i> and <i>A<sub>1</sub></i>. After the sides <i>B</i> and
<i>B<sub>1</sub></i> of the crank webs have been rough-faced, the center-arms
are attached to the ends of the shaft as shown in the illustration.
These arms have centers at <i>D</i> and <i>D<sub>1</sub></i> (located at the required
crank radius) which should be aligned with the rough pin, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_108" id="Pg_108">[108]</a></span>
attaching the arms, and it is advisable to insert braces <i>E</i> between
the arms and crank to take the thrust of the lathe centers.
With the forging supported in this way, the crank-pin and inner
sides of the webs are turned and faced, the work revolving
about the axis of the pin. The turning tools must extend beyond
the tool-holder far enough to allow the crank to clear as it
swings around. Owing to this overhang, the tool should be as
heavy as possible to make it rigid and it is necessary to take
comparatively light cuts and proceed rather cautiously. After
finishing the crank-pin and inside of the crank, the center-arms
are removed and the main body of the shaft and the sides <i>B</i>
and <i>B<sub>1</sub></i> are finished. This method of turning crankshafts is
often used in general repair shops, etc., especially where new
shafts do not have to be turned very often. It is slow and inefficient,
however, and where crankshafts are frequently turned,
special machines or attachments are used.</p>

</div>

<a name="Secnum_3_18" id="Secnum_3_18"></a><p><b>Special Crankshaft Lathe.</b>&mdash;A lathe having special equipment
for rough-turning gas engine crankshaft pins is shown in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_109" id="Pg_109">[109]</a></span>
<a href="#Fig_3_26">Fig. 26</a>. This lathe is a heavy-duty type built by the R. K.
LeBlond Machine Tool Co. It is equipped with special adjustable
headstock and tailstock fixtures designed to take crankshafts
having strokes up to about 6 inches. The tools are held
in a three-tool turret type of toolpost and there are individual
cross-stops for each tool. This lathe also has a roller steadyrest
for supporting the crankshaft; automatic stops for the
longitudinal feed, and a pump for supplying cutting lubricant.
The headstock fixture is carried on a faceplate mounted on the
spindle and so arranged as to be adjustable for cranks of different
throw. When the proper adjustment for a given throw has
been made, the slide is secured by four T-bolts. A graduated
scale and adjusting screw permit of accurate adjustments.</p>

<p>The revolving fixture is accurately indexed for locating different
crank-pins in line with the lathe centers, by a hardened steel
plunger in the slide which engages with hardened bushings in
the fixture. The index is so divided that the fixture may be
rotated 120 or 180 degrees, making it adjustable for 2-, 4- and
6-throw cranks. After indexing, the fixture is clamped by two
T-bolts which engage a circular T-slot. The revolving fixture
is equipped with removable split bushings which can be replaced
to fit the line bearings of different sized crankshafts.
The work is driven by a V-shaped dovetail piece having a
hand-nut adjustment, which also centers the pin by the cheek
or web. The crank is held in position by a hinged clamp on
the fixture. The tailstock fixture is also adjustable and it is
mounted on a spindle which revolves in a bushing in the tailstock
barrel. The adjustment is obtained in the same manner
as on the headstock fixture, and removable split bushings as
well as a hinged clamp are also employed.</p>

<p>The method of chucking a four-throw crank is as follows:
The two fixtures are brought into alignment by two locking
pins. One of these is located in the head and enters a bushing
in the large faceplate and the other is in the tailstock and engages
the tailstock fixture. The crankshaft is delivered to the
machine with the line bearings rough-turned and it is clamped
by the hinged clamp previously referred to and centered by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_110" id="Pg_110">[110]</a></span>
V-shaped driver. The locking pins for both fixtures are then
withdrawn and the machine is ready to turn two of the pins.
After these have been machined, the fixtures are again aligned
by the locking pins, the two T-bolts of the headstock fixture
and the hinged clamp at the tailstock are released, the indexing
plunger is withdrawn and the headstock fixture and crank are
turned 180 degrees or until the index plunger drops into place.
The crank is then clamped at the tailstock end and the revolving
fixture is secured by the two T-bolts previously referred to.
After the locking pins are withdrawn, the lathe is ready to
turn the two opposite pins.</p>

<a name="Secnum_3_19" id="Secnum_3_19"></a><p><b>Operation of Special Crankshaft Lathe.</b>&mdash;The total equipment
of this machine (see <a href="#Fig_3_27">Fig. 27</a>) is carried on a three-tool
turret tool-block. The method of turning a crankshaft is as
follows: A round-nosed turning tool is first fed into a cross stop
as illustrated in the plan view at <i>A</i>, which gives the proper
diameter. The feed is then engaged and the tool feeds across
the pin until the automatic stop lever engages the first stop,
which throws out the feed automatically. The carriage is then
moved against a positive stop by means of the handwheel.
The roller back-rest is next adjusted against the work by the
cross-feed handwheel operating through a telescopic screw, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_111" id="Pg_111">[111]</a></span>
the filleting tools are brought into position as at <i>B</i>. These are
run in against a stop, removing the part left by the turning tool
and giving the pin the proper width and fillets of the correct
radius. If the crankshaft has straight webs which must be
finished, two tools seen at <i>b</i> are used for facing the webs to
the correct width. During these last two operations, the crank
is supported by the roller back-rest, thus eliminating any tendency
of the work to spring.</p>

<p>After one pin is finished in the manner described, the back-rest
is moved out of the way, the automatic stop lever raised,
the carriage shifted to the next pin, and the operation repeated.
The tools are held in position on the turret by studs,
and they can be moved and other tools quickly substituted for
pins of different widths. This machine is used for rough-turning
the pins close to the required size, the finishing operation
being done in a grinder. It should be mentioned, in
passing, that many crankshafts, especially the lighter designs
used in agricultural machinery, etc., are not turned at all but
are ground from the rough.</p>

<a name="Secnum_3_20" id="Secnum_3_20"></a><p><b>Spherical Turning.</b>&mdash;Occasionally it may be necessary to
turn a spherical surface in the lathe. Sketch <i>A</i>, <a href="#Fig_3_28">Fig. 28</a>, shows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_112" id="Pg_112">[112]</a></span>
how a small ball-shaped end can be turned on a piece held in a
chuck. The lathe carriage is adjusted so that the pin around
which the compound rest swivels is directly under the center a.
The bolts which hold the swivel are slightly loosened to allow
the top slide to be turned, as indicated by the dotted lines;
this causes the tool point to move in an arc about center <i>a</i>, and
a spherical surface is turned. Light cuts must be taken as
otherwise it would be difficult to turn the slide around by
hand.</p>

<p>Sketch <i>B</i> illustrates how a concave surface can be turned.
The cross-slide is adjusted until swivel pin is in line with the
lathe centers, and the carriage is moved along the bed until
the horizontal distance between center <i>b</i> of the swivel, and the
face of the work, equals the desired radius of the concave surface.
The turning is then done by swinging the compound
rest as indicated by the dotted lines. The slide can be turned
more evenly by using the tailstock center to force it around.
A projecting bar is clamped across the end of the slide at <i>d</i>, to
act as a lever, and a centered bar is placed between this lever
and the tailstock center; then by screwing out the tailstock
spindle, the slide is turned about pivot <i>b</i>. The alignment between
the swivel pin and the lathe centers can be tested by
taking a trial cut; if the swivel pin is too far forward, the tool
will not touch the turned surface if moved past center <i>c</i>, and if
the pin is too far back, the tool will cut in on the rear side.</p>

<b>Spherical Turning Attachments.</b>&mdash;When spherical turning
must be done repeatedly, special attachments are sometimes
used. <a href="#Fig_3_29">Fig. 29</a> shows an attachment applied to a lathe for turning
the spherical ends of ball-and-socket joints. The height or
radius of the cutting tool and, consequently, the diameter of
the turned ball, is regulated by adjusting screw <i>A</i>. The tool is
swung around in an arc, by turning handle <i>B</i> which revolves a
worm meshing with an enclosed worm-wheel. As will be seen,
the work is held in a special chuck, owing to its irregular
shape.</p>

<p>Another spherical turning attachment is shown in <a href="#Fig_3_30">Fig. 30</a>.
This is used for machining the ends of gasoline engine pistons.
The cross-slide has bolted to it a bar <i>A</i> carrying a roller which
is pressed against a forming plate <i>B</i> by a heavy spring <i>C</i>. The
forming plate <i>B</i>, which is attached to a cross-piece fastened to
the ways of the lathe bed, is curved to correspond with the
radius required on the piston end, and when the tool is fed
laterally by moving the cross-slide, it follows the curve of plate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_114" id="Pg_114">[114]</a></span>
<i>B</i>. The piston is held in a special hollow chuck which locates
it in a central position and holds it rigidly.</p>

<p>In connection with lathe work, special attachments and tools
are often used, especially when considerable work of one class
must be turned; however, if a certain part is required in large
quantities, it is usually more economical to use some semi-automatic
or automatic turning machine, especially designed
for repetition work.</p>

</div>

<a name="Secnum_3_22" id="Secnum_3_22"></a><p><b>Turning with Front and Rear Tools.</b>&mdash;In ordinary engine
lathe practice, one tool is used at a time, but some lathes are
equipped with tool-holders at the front and rear of the carriage
so that two tools can be used simultaneously. <a href="#Fig_3_31">Fig. 31</a> shows a
detail view of a lathe in which front and rear tools are being
used. These tools are of the inserted cutter type and the one
at the rear is inverted, as the rotary movement of the work is,
of course, upward on the rear side. This particular lathe was
designed for taking heavy roughing cuts and has considerable
driving power.</p>

<p>The part shown in this illustration is a chrome-nickel steel
bar which is being roughed out to form a milling machine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_115" id="Pg_115">[115]</a></span>
spindle. It is necessary to reduce the diameter of the bar from
5<sup class="enum">7</sup>/<sub class="denom">16</sub> inches to 3<sup class="enum">3</sup>/<sub
class="denom">4</sub> inches for a length of 27 inches, because of a
collar on one end. This reduction is made in one passage of the
two tools, with a feed of <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">32</sub> inch per revolution and a speed of
60 revolutions per minute. The use of two tools for such heavy
roughing cuts is desirable, especially when the parts are required
in large quantities, because the thrust of the cut on one
side, which tends to deflect the work, is counteracted by the
thrust on the opposite side.</p>

<p>Sometimes special tool-holders are made for the lathe, so
that more than one tool can be used for turning different surfaces
or diameters at the same time, the tools being set in the
proper relation to each other. The advantage of this method
has resulted in the design of a special lathe for multiple-tool
turning.</p>

<a name="Secnum_3_23" id="Secnum_3_23"></a><p><b>A Multiple-tool Lathe.</b>&mdash;The lathe shown in <a href="#Fig_3_32">Fig. 32</a> (which
is built by the Fitchburg Machine Works and is known as the
Lo-swing) is designed especially for turning shafts, pins and
forgings not exceeding 3<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub> inches in diameter. It has two carriages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_116" id="Pg_116">[116]</a></span>
<i>A</i> and <i>B</i> which, in conjunction with special tool-holders,
make it possible to turn several different diameters simultaneously.
At the front of this lathe there is an automatic stop-rod
<i>C</i> for disengaging the feed when the tools have turned a
surface to the required length. This stop-rod carries adjustable
stops <i>D</i> which are set to correspond with shoulders, etc.,
on the work. The rod itself is also adjustable axially, so that
the tools, which are usually arranged in groups of two or more
(depending upon the nature of the work), can be disengaged at
a point nearer or farther from the headstock as may be required,
owing to a variation in the depth of center holes. For example,
if it were necessary to feed a group of tools farther toward the
headstock after they had been automatically disengaged, the
entire rod with its stops would be adjusted the required amount
in that direction.</p>

<p>The gage <i>G</i>, which is attached to a swinging arm, is used to
set the stop bar with reference to a shoulder near the end of
the work, when it is necessary to finish other parts to a given
distance from such a shoulder or other surface. The use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_117" id="Pg_117">[117]</a></span>
this gage will be explained more fully later. Cooling lubricant
for the tools is supplied through the tubes <i>E</i>. The lathe shown
in the illustration is arranged for turning Krupp steel bars.
A rough bar and also one that has been turned may be seen to
the right. The plain cylindrical bar is turned to five different
diameters, by groups of tools held on both carriages.</p>

and <a href="#Fig_3_34">34</a> show how a Lo-swing lathe is used for turning the steering knuckle of an
automobile. Four tools are used in this case, three cylindrical
surfaces and one tapering surface being turned at the same
time. For this job, the four tools are mounted on one carriage.
The taper part is turned by the second tool from the
headstock, which is caused to feed outward as the carriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_118" id="Pg_118">[118]</a></span>
advances by a taper attachment. This tool is held in a special
holder and bears against a templet at the rear, which is tapered
to correspond with the taper to be turned. This templet is
attached to a bar which, in turn, is fastened to a stationary
bracket seen to the extreme left in <a href="#Fig_3_33">Fig. 33</a>. This part is finished
in two operations, the tool setting being identical for each
operation, except for diameter adjustments. As the illustrations
show, three of the four tools employed are used for straight
turning on different diameters, while the fourth finishes the
taper.</p>

<a name="Fig_3_34" id="Fig_3_34"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><div class="illobox450"><img src="images/125sm.png" alt="Plan View showing Method of driving Steering Knuckle and Arrangement of Tools" /></div>
<p class="caption750">Fig. 34. Plan View showing Method of driving Steering Knuckle and
Arrangement of Tools</p>
</div>

<p>These pieces, which are rough drop forgings, are first reduced
to the approximate size. When it becomes necessary to
grind the tools, they are reset and those parts which have been
roughed out are turned to the finished size. The average time
for the first operation, which includes starting, stopping, turning
and replacing the piece, is one minute, while for the second
operation with the finer feed, an average time of two minutes
is required. The work is driven by sleeve <i>S</i>, which fits over the
spindle and is held in position by the regular driver, as shown.
This sleeve is notched to fit the knuckle, so that the latter can
easily and quickly be replaced when finished.</p>

<p>One of the interesting features of this job lies in the method
of locating the shoulders on each knuckle, at the same distance
from the hole <i>H</i> which is drilled previously, and which receives
the bolt on which the knuckle swivels when assembled
in a car. As soon as the knuckle has been placed between the
centers, a close-fitting plug <i>P</i> (<a href="#Fig_3_33">Fig. 33</a>) is inserted in this hole
and the indicator arm with its attached gage or caliper <i>G</i> is
swung up to the position shown. The stop-rod on which the
stops have been previously set for the correct distance between
the shoulders is next adjusted axially until the gage <i>G</i>
just touches the plug <i>P</i>. The indicator is then swung out of
the way, and the piece turned. If the next knuckle were
centered, say, deeper than the previous one which would, of
course, cause it to be located nearer the headstock, obviously
all the shoulders would be located farther from the finished
hole, provided the position of the stops remained the same as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_119" id="Pg_119">[119]</a></span>
before. In such a case their position would, however, be changed
by shifting the stop-rod until the gage <i>G</i> again touched the plug
thus locating all the stops with reference to the hole. As the
adjustment of the stop-rod changes the position of the taper
templet as well as the stops, it is evident that both the shoulders
and the taper are finished the same distance from the hole in
each case. The connection of the bracket (to which the templet
arm is attached) with the stop-rod is clearly shown in <a href="#Fig_3_33">Fig. 33</a>.
This bracket can either be locked to the ways or adjusted to
slide when the stop-rod is moved.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 35. First and Second Operations on Automobile Transmission
Shaft&mdash;Lo-swing Lathe</p>
</div>

<p>The part illustrated in <a href="#Fig_3_35">Fig. 35</a> is an automobile transmission
shaft. In this particular case, cylindrical, tapering and spherical
surfaces are turned. The upper view shows, diagrammatically,
the arrangement of the tools and work for the first operation.
After the shaft is &#8220;spotted&#8221; at <i>A</i> for the steadyrest, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_120" id="Pg_120">[120]</a></span>
straight part <i>C</i> and the collar <i>B</i> are sized with tools <i>S</i> and <i>R</i>
which are mounted on the left-hand carriage. A concave groove
is then cut in collar <i>B</i> by tool <i>R</i>, after which spherical end <i>D</i> is
formed by a special attachment mounted on the right-hand carriage.
This attachment is the same, in principle, as the regular
taper-turning attachment, the substitution of a circular templet
<i>T</i> for the straight kind used on taper work being the only practical
difference.</p>

<p>After the surfaces mentioned have been finished on a number
of pieces, the work is reversed and the tools changed as shown
by the lower view. The first step in the second operation is to
turn the body <i>E</i> of the shaft with the tool <i>T</i> on the left-hand
carriage. The taper <i>F</i> and the straight part <i>G</i> are then finished,
which completes the turning. It will be noted that in setting
up the machine for this second operation, it is arranged for
taper turning by simply replacing the circular templet with the
straight one shown. When this taper attachment is not in use,
the swiveling arm <i>M</i>, which is attached to a bracket, is swung
out of the way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_121" id="Pg_121">[121]</a></span>The method of driving this shaft is worthy of note. A dog
having two driving arms each of which bears against a pin <i>N</i>
that passes through a hole in the spindle is used. As the ends
of this pin, against which the dog bears, are beveled in opposite
directions, the pin turns in its hole when the dog makes contact
with it and automatically adjusts itself against the two driving
members of the dog. The advantage of driving by a two-tailed
dog, as most mechanics know, is in equalizing the tendency
to spring slender parts while they are being turned.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 36. Axle End turned in One Traverse of the Five Tools shown</p>
</div>

<p>In <a href="#Fig_3_36">Fig. 36</a> another turning operation on a lathe of this type
is shown, the work in this case being a rear axle for a motor
truck. The turning of this part is a good example of that class
of work where the rapid removal of metal is the important
feature. As the engraving shows, the stock, prior to turning,
is 3<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub> inches in diameter and it is reduced to a minimum diameter
of 1<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">16</sub> inch. This metal is turned off with one traverse of
the carriage or by one passage of the five tools, and the weight
of the chips removed from each end of the axle is approximately
12 pounds. The time required for the actual turning is about
9 minutes, while the total time for the operation, which includes
placing the heavy piece in the machine, turning, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_122" id="Pg_122">[122]</a></span>
removing the work from the lathe, is 12 minutes. The axle revolves,
while being turned, at 110 revolutions per minute and a
feed equivalent to 1 inch of tool travel to 60 revolutions of the
work is used. It will be noticed that the taper attachment is also
employed on this part, the taper being turned by the second
tool from the left. As the axle is equipped with roller bearings,
it was found desirable to finish the bearing part by a separate
operation; therefore, in the operation shown the axle is simply
roughed down rather close to the finished dimensions, leaving
enough material for a light finishing cut.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 37. Lathe Knurling Tool having Three Pairs of Knurls&mdash;Coarse,
Medium and Fine</p>
</div>

<a name="Secnum_3_25" id="Secnum_3_25"></a><p><b>Knurling in the Lathe.</b>&mdash;Knurling is done either to provide
a rough surface which can be firmly gripped by the hand or for
producing an ornamental effect. The handles of gages and
other tools are often knurled, and the thumb-screws used on
instruments, etc., usually have knurled edges. A knurled surface
consists of a series of small ridges or diamond-shaped projections,
and is produced in the lathe by the use of a tool similar
to the one shown in <a href="#Fig_3_37">Fig. 37</a>, this being one of several different
designs in common use. The knurling is done by two knurls
<i>A</i> and <i>B</i> having teeth or ridges which incline to the right on one
knurl and to the left on the opposite knurl, as shown by the
end view. When these two knurls are pressed against the work
as the latter revolves, one knurl forms a series of left-hand
ridges and the other knurl right-hand ridges, which cross and
form the diamond-shaped knurling which is generally used.</p>

<p>If the surface to be knurled is wider than the knurls, the
power feed of the lathe should be engaged and the knurling tool
be traversed back and forth until the diamond-shaped projections
are well formed. To prevent forming a double set of
projections, feed the knurl in with considerable pressure at the
start, then partially relieve the pressure before engaging the
power feed. Use oil when knurling.</p>

<p>The knurls commonly used for lathe work have spiral teeth
and ordinarily there are three classes, known as coarse, medium
and fine. The medium pitch is generally used. The teeth of
coarse knurls have a spiral angle of 36 degrees and the pitch
of the knurled cut (measured parallel to the axis of the work)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_123" id="Pg_123">[123]</a></span>
should be about 8 per inch. For medium knurls, the spiral
angle is 29<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub> degrees and the pitch, measured as before, is 12
per inch. For fine knurls, the spiral angle is 25<sup class="enum">3</sup>/<sub class="denom">4</sub> degrees and
the pitch 20 per inch. The knurls should be about <sup class="enum">3</sup>/<sub class="denom">4</sub> inch in
diameter and <sup class="enum">3</sup>/<sub class="denom">8</sub> inch wide. When made to these dimensions,
coarse knurls have 34 teeth; medium, 50 teeth; and fine knurls,
80 teeth.</p>

<p>The particular tool illustrated in <a href="#Fig_3_37">Fig. 37</a> has three pairs of
knurls of coarse, medium and fine pitch. These are mounted
in a revolving holder which not only serves to locate the required
set of knurls in the working position, but enables each
knurl to bear against the surface with equal pressure. Concave
knurls are sometimes used for knurling rounded edges on screw
heads, etc.</p>

<a name="Secnum_3_26" id="Secnum_3_26"></a><p><b>Relieving Attachment.</b>&mdash;Some lathes, particularly those used
in toolrooms, are provided with relieving attachments which
are used for &#8220;backing off&#8221; the teeth of milling cutters, taps,
hobs, etc. If a milling cutter of special shape is to be made, the
cutter blank is first turned to the required form with a special
tool having a cutting edge that corresponds with the shape or
profile of the cutter to be made. The blank is then fluted or
gashed to form the teeth, after which the tops of the teeth are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_124" id="Pg_124">[124]</a></span>
relieved or backed off to provide clearance for the cutting edges.
The forming tool used for turning the blank is set to match the
turned surface, and the teeth are backed off as the result of a
reciprocating action imparted to the toolslide by the relieving
attachment. The motion of the toolslide is so adjusted that
the tool will meet the front of each tooth and the return movement
begin promptly after the tool leaves the back end of the
tooth.</p>

<a name="Fig_3_38" id="Fig_3_38"></a>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 38. Hendey Relieving Attachment applied to a Lathe</p>
</div>

<p>These attachments differ somewhat in their construction and
arrangement but the principle of their operation is similar.
<a href="#Fig_3_38">Fig. 38</a> shows a Hendey relieving attachment applied to a lathe.
A bracket carrying the gearing <i>A</i> through which the attachment
is driven is mounted upon the main gear box of the lathe, and
the special slide <i>B</i>, which is used when relieving, is placed on
the cross-slide after removing the regular compound rest. The
gears at <i>A</i> are changed to suit the number of flutes or gashes in
the cutter, tap or whatever is to be relieved. If we assume that
the work is a formed milling cutter having nine teeth, then with
this particular attachment, a gear having 90 teeth would be
placed on the &#8220;stud&#8221; and a 40-tooth gear on the cam-shaft, the
two gears being connected by a 60-tooth intermediate gear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_125" id="Pg_125">[125]</a></span>
With this combination of gearing, the toolslide would move in
and out nine times for each revolution of the work, so that the
tool could back off the top of each tooth. (The gearing to use
for various numbers of flutes is shown by an index plate on the
attachment.) The amount of relief is varied to suit the work
being done, by means of a toothed coupling which makes it
possible to change the relative position between the eccentric
which actuates the toolslide and the cam lever, thereby lengthening
or shortening the reciprocating travel of the tool.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 39. Relieving a Formed Cutter</p>
</div>

<a name="Secnum_3_27" id="Secnum_3_27"></a><p><b>Application of Relieving Attachment.</b>&mdash;Some typical examples
of the kind of work for which the relieving attachment
is used are shown in <a href="#Fig_3_39">Figs. 39</a> to <a href="#Fig_3_42">42</a>, inclusive. <a href="#Fig_3_39">Fig. 39</a> shows
how a formed milling cutter is relieved. The toolslide is set at
right angles to the axis of the work, and the tool moves in as
each tooth passes, and out while crossing the spaces or flutes
between the teeth. As the result of this movement, the tops of
the teeth are backed off eccentrically but the form or shape is
the same from the front to the back of the tooth; hence, a
cutter that has been relieved in this way can be ground repeatedly
without changing the profile of the teeth, provided the
faces are ground so as to lie in a radial plane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_126" id="Pg_126">[126]</a></span>When relieving, the cutting speed should be much less than
when turning in order to give the toolslide time to operate
properly. A maximum of 180 teeth per minute is recommended,
and, if wide forming tools are used, it might be advisable
to reduce the speed so low that only 8 teeth per minute
would be relieved. It is also essential to use a tool having a keen
edge, and the toolslide should work freely but be closely adjusted
to the dovetail of the lower slide. Before beginning to
back off the teeth, it is a good plan to color the work either by
heating it or dipping into a strong solution of copper sulphate.
This will enable one to see plainly the cutting action of the
tool in order to stop relieving at the proper time.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/133sm.jpg" alt="Relieving Side of Angular Milling Cutter" />
<p class="caption750">Fig. 40. Relieving Side of Angular Milling Cutter</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#Fig_3_40">Fig. 40</a> shows a method of relieving the teeth of an angular
cutter. For an operation of this kind the toolslide is swiveled
around at right angles to the side that is to be relieved. By
the use of an additional universal joint and bearing to permit
the toolslide to be swung to a 90-degree angle, the teeth of
counterbores, etc., can be relieved on the ends. When the attachment
is used for relieving inside work, such as hollow mills
and threading dies, the eccentric which controls the travel of
the toolslide is set so that the relieving movement is away from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_127" id="Pg_127">[127]</a></span>
the axis of the cutter instead of toward it. This change is
made by the toothed coupling previously referred to, which
connects the cam lever and oscillating shaft, the latter being
turned beyond the zero mark in a clockwise direction as far as
is necessary to obtain the desired amount of travel. For internal
work it is also necessary to change the position of the
opposing spring of the toolslide, so that it will press against
the end of the slide and prevent the tool from jumping into
the work.</p>

<a name="Fig_3_41" id="Fig_3_41"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/134sm.jpg" alt="Relieving a Right-hand Tap" />
<p class="caption750">Fig. 41. Relieving a Right-hand Tap</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#Fig_3_41">Fig. 41</a> shows how a right-hand tap is relieved. The ordinary
practice is to first set the tool the same as for cutting a thread.
The motion of the toolslide is then adjusted so that the tool on
the forward stroke will meet the front of each tooth, and start
back as soon as the tool leaves the end of the land or top of the
tooth. Taps having a left-hand thread can be relieved by two
different methods. With the first method the cut starts at the
cutting edge of each tooth, and ends at the &#8220;heel,&#8221; the tool
moving in toward the center of the work. With the second
method, the cut begins at the heel and discontinues at the cutting
edge, the tool being drawn away from the work during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_128" id="Pg_128">[128]</a></span>
cut. When using the first method the tap must be placed with
the point toward the headstock, the shank end being supported
by the tailstock center. This is done by providing an
extension or blank end at the point of the tap long enough to
hold the driving dog. With the second method, the tap is held
between centers the same as one having a right-hand thread,
but the travel of the toolslide is set the same as for inside relief.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/135sm.jpg" alt="Relieving a Hob having Spiral Flutes" />
<p class="caption750">Fig. 42. Relieving a Hob having Spiral Flutes</p>
</div>

<a name="Secnum_3_28" id="Secnum_3_28"></a><p><b>Relieving Hobs or Taps Having Spiral Flutes.</b>&mdash;With
this attachment, taps or hobs having &#8220;spiral&#8221; or helical flutes
can also be relieved. (A spiral flute is preferable to one that is
parallel to the axis, because with the former the tool has cutting
edges which are square with the teeth; this is of especial importance
when the lead of the hob or tap thread is considerable.)
When relieving work having spiral flutes (as illustrated in <a href="#Fig_3_42">Fig.
42</a>), the lead of the spiral and the gears necessary to drive the
attachment are first determined. After the attachment is
geared for the number of flutes and to compensate for the spiral,
the lead-screw is engaged and the backing-off operation is
performed the same as though the flutes were straight. The
carriage should not be disengaged from the lead-screw after
starting the cut, the tool being returned by reversing the lathe.</p>

<p>When gearing the attachment for relieving a tap or hob
having spiral flutes, the gears are not selected for the actual
number of flutes around the circumference but for a somewhat
larger number which depends upon the lead of the hob thread
and the lead of the spiral flutes. Let us assume that a hob
has 6 spiral flutes and that the attachment is geared for that
number. The result would be that as the tool advanced along
the thread, it would not keep &#8220;in step&#8221; with the teeth because
the faces of the teeth lie along a spiral (or helix which is the
correct name for this curve); in other words, the tool would
soon be moving in too late to begin cutting at the proper time,
and to compensate for this, the attachment is geared so that the
tool will make a greater number of strokes per revolution of the
work than the actual number of flutes around the circumference.</p>

<p>With this attachment, the two gears listed on the index plate
for the actual number of flutes are selected, and then two compensating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_129" id="Pg_129">[129]</a></span>
gears are added, thus forming a compound train of
gearing. The ratio <i>R</i> of these compensating gears is determined
as follows:</p>

<table class="formula" summary="Formula 129_1">
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;<i>r</i> + 1&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;<i>R</i>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;<i>r</i>&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>

in which

<tr><td>&nbsp;<i>l</i>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;lead of hob thread.&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>

<p>For example, if a hob has a pitch circumference of 3.25, a
single thread of 0.75 inch lead, and 6 spiral flutes, what compensating
gears would be required?</p>

<p>The lead <i>L</i> of the spiral flutes is first determined by dividing
the square of the circumference <i>C</i> of the hob at the pitch line by
the lead <i>l</i> of the hob thread. Thus lead <i>L = C<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;l</i>, or, in this case,
<i>L</i> = 3.25<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;0.75 = 14 inches, approximately. Then <i>r</i> = 14&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;0.75 =
18<sup class="enum">2</sup>/<sub class="denom">3</sub>. Inserting these values in the formula for ratio R,</p>

<p>Hence, the compensating gears will have 56 and 59 teeth, respectively,
the latter being the driver. As the gears for 6 flutes
listed on the regular index plate are, stud-gear 60 teeth, cam-shaft
gear 40 teeth, the entire train of gears would be as follows:
Gear on stud, 60; <i>driven</i> intermediate gear, 56; <i>driving</i> intermediate
gear, 59; cam-shaft gear, 40. It will be understood that
the position of the driving gears or the driven gears can be
transposed without affecting the ratio.</p>

<a name="Secnum_3_29" id="Secnum_3_29"></a><p><b>Classes of Fits Used in Machine Construction.</b>&mdash;In assembling
machine parts it is necessary to have some members fit
together tightly, whereas other parts such as shafts, etc., must be
free to move or revolve with relation to each other. The accuracy
required for a fitting varies for different classes of work.
A shaft that revolves in its bearing must be slightly smaller
than the bearing so that there will be room for a film of lubricant.
A crank-pin that must be forced into the crank-disk is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_130" id="Pg_130">[130]</a></span>
made a little larger in diameter than the hole, to secure a tight
fit. When a very accurate fitting between two cylindrical parts
that must be assembled without pressure is required, the
diameter of the inner member is made as close to the diameter
of the outer member as is possible. In ordinary machine construction,
five classes of fits are used, <i>viz</i>; running fit, push
fit, driving fit, forced fit and shrinkage fit. The running fit,
as the name implies, is employed when parts must rotate; the
push fit is not sufficiently free to rotate; the other classes referred
to are used for assembling parts that must be held in
fixed positions.</p>

<a name="Secnum_3_30" id="Secnum_3_30"></a><p><b>Forced Fits.</b>&mdash;This is the term used when a pin, shaft or
other cylindrical part is forced into a hole of slightly smaller
diameter, by the use of a hydraulic press or other means. As a
rule, forced fits are restricted to parts of small and medium
size, while shrinkage fits have no such limitations and are especially
applicable when a maximum &#8220;grip&#8221; is desired, or when
(as in the construction of ordnance) accurate results as to the
intensity of stresses produced in the parts united are required.
The proper allowance for a forced fit depends upon the mass of
metal surrounding the hole, the size of the work, the kind and
quality of the material of which the parts are composed and the
smoothness and accuracy of the pin and bore. When a pin or
other part is pressed into a hole a second time, the allowance
for a given tonnage should be diminished somewhat because the
surface of the bore is smoother and the metal more compact.
The pressure required in assembling a forced fit will also vary
for cast hubs of the same size, if they are not uniform in hardness.
Then there is the personal factor which is much in evidence
in work of this kind; hence, data and formulas for forced
fit allowances must be general in their application.</p>

</span>Tolerance is provided for holes, which ordinary standard reamers can produce, in two grades,
Classes A and B, the selection of which is a question for the user's decision and dependent upon
the quality of the work required; some prefer to use Class A as working limits and Class B as
inspection limits.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Fn_3" id="Fn_3"></a><span class="label"><a href="#Fnanchor_3">[2]</a>
</span>Running fits, which are the most commonly required, are divided into three grades:
Class X for engine and other work where easy fits are wanted; Class Y for high speeds and good
average machine work; Class Z for fine tool work.</p>
<hr class="l10" />

<a name="Secnum_3_31" id="Secnum_3_31"></a><p><b>Allowance for Forced Fits.</b>&mdash;The allowance per inch of
diameter usually ranges from 0.001 inch to 0.0025 inch, 0.0015
being a fair average. Ordinarily, the allowance per inch decreases
as the diameter increases; thus the total allowance for
a diameter of 2 inches might be 0.004 inch, whereas for a diameter
of 8 inches the total allowance might not be over 0.009 or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_132" id="Pg_132">[132]</a></span>
0.010 inch. In some shops the allowance is made practically
the same for all diameters, the increased surface area of the
larger sizes giving sufficient increase in pressure. The parts to
be assembled by forced fits are usually made cylindrical, although
sometimes they are slightly tapered. The advantages
of the taper form are that the possibility of abrasion of the
fitted surfaces is reduced; that less pressure is required in
assembling; and that the parts are more readily separated
when renewal is required. On the other hand, the taper fit is
less reliable, because if it loosens, the entire fit is free with but
little axial movement. Some lubricant, such as white lead and
lard oil mixed to the consistency of paint, should be applied to
the pin and bore before assembling, to reduce the tendency of
abrasion.</p>

<a name="Secnum_3_32" id="Secnum_3_32"></a><p><b>Pressure for Forced Fits.</b>&mdash;The pressure required for assembling
cylindrical parts depends not only upon the allowance for
the fit, but also upon the area of the fitted surfaces, the pressure
increasing in proportion to the distance that the inner member
is forced in. The approximate ultimate pressure in pounds can
be determined by the use of the following formula in conjunction
with the accompanying table of &#8220;<a href="#Pg_132">Pressure Factors</a>.&#8221;</p>

<a name="Secnum_3_34" id="Secnum_3_34"></a><p><b>Shrinkage Fits.</b>&mdash;When heat is applied to a piece of metal,
such as iron or steel, as is commonly known, a certain amount
of expansion takes place which increases as the temperature
is increased, and also varies somewhat with different kinds of
metal, copper and brass expanding more for a given increase in
temperature than iron and steel. When any part which has
been expanded by the application of heat is cooled, it contracts
and resumes its original size. This expansive property of
metals has been taken advantage of by mechanics in assembling
various machine details. A cylindrical part which is to be held
in position by a shrinkage fit is first turned a few thousandths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_134" id="Pg_134">[134]</a></span>
of an inch larger than the hole; the diameter of the latter is
then increased by heating, and after the part is inserted, the
heated outer member is cooled, causing it to grip the pin or
shaft with tremendous pressure.</p>

<p>General practice seems to favor a smaller allowance for
shrinkage fits than for forced fits, although in many shops the
allowances are practically the same in each case, and for some
classes of work, shrinkage allowances exceed those for forced
fits. In any case, the shrinkage allowance varies to a great extent
with the form and construction of the part which has to be
shrunk into place. The thickness or amount of metal around
the hole is the most important factor. The way in which the
metal is distributed also has an influence on the results. Shrinkage
allowances for locomotive driving wheel tires adopted by the
American Railway Master Mechanics Association are as follows:</p>

<table class="center" align="center" border="0" summary="Shrinkage allowances">
<tr><td class="left">Center diameter, inches&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;38&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;44&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;50&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;56&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;62&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;66&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Allowance, inches&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;0.040&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;0.047&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;0.053&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;0.060&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;0.066&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;0.070&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Whether parts are to be assembled by forced or shrinkage
fits depends upon conditions. For example, to press a driving
wheel tire over its wheel center, without heating, would ordinarily
be a rather awkward and difficult job. On the other
hand, pins, etc., are easily and quickly forced into place with a
hydraulic press and there is the additional advantage of knowing
the exact pressure required in assembling, whereas there is
more or less uncertainty connected with a shrinkage fit, unless
the stresses are calculated. Tests to determine the difference
in the quality of shrinkage and forced fits showed that the resistance
of a shrinkage fit to slippage was, for an axial pull,
3.66 times greater than that of a forced fit, and in rotation or
torsion, 3.2 times greater. In each comparative test, the dimensions
and allowances were the same.</p>

<p>The most important point to consider when calculating
shrinkage fits is the stress in the hub at the bore, which depends
chiefly upon the shrinkage allowance. If the allowance
is excessive, the elastic limit of the material will be exceeded
and permanent set will occur, or, in extreme cases, the ultimate
strength of the metal will be exceeded and the hub will burst.</p>

<h3>THREAD CUTTING IN THE LATHE</h3>
<hr class="c05" />

<p>When threads are cut in the lathe a tool <i>t</i> is used (see <a href="#Fig_4_2">Fig. 2</a>),
having a point corresponding to the shape of the thread, and
the carriage is moved along the bed a certain distance for each
revolution of the work (the distance depending on the number
of threads to the inch being cut) by the lead-screw <i>S</i> which is
rotated by gears <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, which receive their motion from the
spindle. As the amount that the carriage travels per revolution
of the work, and, consequently, the number of threads
per inch that is cut, depends on the size of the gears <i>a</i> and <i>c</i>
(called change gears) the latter have to be changed for cutting
different threads. The proper change gears to use for cutting
a given number of threads to the inch is ordinarily determined
by referring to a table or &#8220;index plate&#8221; <i>I</i> which shows what the
size of gears <i>a</i> and <i>c</i> should be, or the number of teeth each
should have, for cutting any given number of threads per inch.</p>

<a name="Secnum_4_1" id="Secnum_4_1"></a><p><b>Selecting the Change Gears for Thread Cutting.</b>&mdash;Suppose a
V-thread is to be cut on the end of the bolt <i>B</i>, Fig. 2, having
a diameter of 1<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">4</sub> inch and seven threads per inch of length, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_137" id="Pg_137">[137]</a></span>
shown at <i>A</i> in <a href="#Fig_4_1">Fig. 1</a>, which is the standard number of threads
per inch for that diameter. First the change gears to use are
found on plate <i>I</i> which is shown enlarged in <a href="#Fig_4_3">Fig. 3</a>. This plate
has three columns: The first contains different numbers of
threads to the inch, the second the size gear to place on the
&#8220;spindle&#8221; or &#8220;stud&#8221; at <i>a</i> (<a href="#Fig_4_2">Fig. 2</a>) for different threads, and the
third the size of gear <i>c</i> for the lead-screw.
As the thread selected as
an example has 7 threads per inch,
gear <i>a</i> should have 48 teeth, this
being the number given in the
second column opposite figure 7
in the first. By referring to the
last column, we find that the
lead-screw gear should have 84
teeth. These gears are selected
from an assortment provided with
the lathe and they are placed on
the spindle and lead-screw, respectively.</p>

<p>Intermediate gear <i>b</i> does not
need to be changed as it is simply
an &#8220;idler&#8221; for connecting gears <i>a</i>
and <i>c</i>. Gear <i>b</i> is mounted on a
swinging yoke <i>Y</i> so that it can
be adjusted to mesh properly with
different gear combinations; after
this adjustment is made, the lathe
is geared for cutting 7 threads to
the inch. (The change gears of
many modern lathes are so arranged that different combinations
are obtained by simply shifting a lever. A lathe having this
quick-change gear mechanism is described in the latter part of
this chapter.) The work <i>B</i> is placed between the centers just
as it would be for turning, with the end to be threaded turned
to a diameter of 1<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">4</sub> inch, which is the outside diameter of the
thread.</p>

<a name="Secnum_4_2" id="Secnum_4_2"></a><b>The Thread Tool.</b>&mdash;The form of tool used for cutting a
V-thread is shown at <i>A</i>, <a href="#Fig_4_4">Fig. 4</a>. The end is ground V-shaped
and to an angle of 60 degrees, which corresponds to the angle of
a standard V-thread. The front or flank, <i>f</i> of the tool is ground
back at an angle to provide clearance, but the top is left flat or
without slope. As it is very important to grind the end to exactly
60 degrees, a gage <i>G</i> is used, having 60-degree notches to
which the tool-point is fitted. The tool is clamped in the toolpost
as shown in the plan view, <a href="#Fig_4_2">Fig. 2</a>, square with the work, so
that both sides of the thread will be cut to the same angle with
the axis of the work. A very convenient way to set a thread
tool square is illustrated at <i>B</i>, <a href="#Fig_4_1">Fig. 1</a>. The thread gage is placed
against the part to be threaded, as shown, and the tool is adjusted
until the angular sides of the point bear evenly in the
60-degree notch of the gage. The top of the tool point should
be at the same height as the lathe centers, as otherwise the
angle of the thread will not be correct.</p>

</div>

<a name="Secnum_4_3" id="Secnum_4_3"></a><p><b>Cutting the Thread.</b>&mdash;The lathe is now ready for cutting the
thread. This is done by taking several cuts, as indicated at <i>A</i>,
<i>B</i>, <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> in <a href="#Fig_4_5">Fig. 5</a>, the tool being fed in a little farther for
each successive cut until the thread is finished. When these
cuts are being taken, the carriage is moved along the bed, as
previously explained, by the lead-screw <i>S</i>, <a href="#Fig_4_2">Fig. 2</a>. The carriage
is engaged with the lead-screw by turning lever <i>u</i> which causes
the halves of a split nut to close around the screw. The way a
lathe is handled when cutting a thread is as follows: After the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_139" id="Pg_139">[139]</a></span>
lathe is started, the carriage is moved until the tool-point is
slightly beyond the right end of the work, and the tool is fed
in far enough to take the first cut which, ordinarily, would be
about <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">16</sub> inch deep. The carriage is then engaged with the
lead-screw, by operating lever <i>u</i>, and the tool moves to the left
(in this case <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">7</sub> inch for each revolution of the work) and cuts a
winding groove as at <i>A</i>, <a href="#Fig_4_5">Fig. 5</a>. When the tool has traveled as
far as the thread is wanted, it is withdrawn by a quick turn of
cross-slide handle <i>e</i>, and the carriage is returned to the starting
point for another cut. The tool is then fed in a little farther
and a second cut is taken as at <i>B</i>, <a href="#Fig_4_5">Fig. 5</a>, and this operation is
repeated as at <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> until a &#8220;full&#8221; thread is cut or until the
top of the thread is sharp. The thread is then tested for size
but before referring to this part of the work, the way the carriage
is returned to the starting point after each cut should be
explained.</p>

<a name="Fig_4_5" id="Fig_4_5"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><div class="illobox450"><img src="images/147sm.png" alt="Thread is formed by taking a Number of Successive Cuts" /></div>
<p class="caption750">Fig. 5. Thread is formed by taking a Number of Successive Cuts</p>
</div>

<p>When the tool is withdrawn at the end of the first cut, if the
carriage is disengaged from the lead-screw and returned by
hand, the tool may or may not follow the first cut when the carriage
is again engaged with the lead-screw. If the number of
threads to the inch being cut is a multiple of the number on the
lead-screw <i>S</i>, then the carriage can be returned by hand and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_140" id="Pg_140">[140]</a></span>
engaged with the lead-screw at random and the tool will follow
the first cut. For example, if the lead-screw has six threads per
inch, and 6, 12, 18 or any number of threads is being cut that is
a multiple of six, the carriage can be engaged at any time and the
tool will always follow the original cut. This is not the case,
however, when the number of threads being cut is not a multiple
of the number on the lead-screw.</p>

<p>One method of bringing the carriage back to the starting point,
when cutting threads which are not multiples, is to reverse the
lathe (by shifting the overhead driving belts) in order to bring
the tool back to the starting point without disengaging the
carriage; in this way the tool is kept in the same relation to the
work, and the carriage is not disengaged from the lead-screw
until the thread is finished. This is a good method when cutting
short threads having a length of say two or three inches;
but when they are longer, and especially when the diameter is
comparatively large (which means a slower speed), it is rather
slow as considerable time is wasted while the tool is moving
back to its starting point. This is due to the fact that the
carriage is moved slowly by the lead-screw, but when disengaged,
it can be traversed quickly by turning handle <i>d</i>, <a href="#Fig_5_2">Fig. 2</a>.</p>

<p>A method of returning the carriage by hand when the number
of threads being cut is not a multiple of the number on the
lead-screw is as follows: The tool is moved a little beyond the
right end of the work and the carriage or split nut is engaged
with the lead-screw. The lathe is then turned forward by hand
to take up any lost motion, and a line is made on the lathe
bed showing the position of the carriage. The positions of the
spindle and lead-screw are also marked by chalking a tooth on
both the spindle and lead-screw gears, which happens to be
opposite a corner or other point on the bed. After a cut is
taken, the carriage is returned by hand to the original starting
point as shown by the line on the bed, and is again engaged
when the chalk marks show that the spindle and lead-screw are
in their original position; the tool will then follow the first cut.
If the body of the tailstock is moved against the bridge of the
carriage before starting the first cut, the carriage can be located<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_141" id="Pg_141">[141]</a></span>
for each following cut by moving it back against the tailstock,
and it will not be necessary to have a line on the bed.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><div class="illobox450"><img src="images/149sm.png" alt="Indicator used when Cutting Threads" /></div>
<p class="caption750">Fig. 6. Indicator used when Cutting Threads</p>
</div>

<a name="Secnum_4_4" id="Secnum_4_4"></a><p><b>Indicator or Chasing Dial for Catching Threads.</b>&mdash;On some
lathes there is an indicator for &#8220;catching threads,&#8221; as this is
called in shop language. This is a simple device attached to
the carriage and consists
of a graduated
dial <i>D</i> and a worm-wheel
<i>W</i> (see <a href="#Fig_4_2">Figs. 2</a>
and <a href="#Fig_4_6">6</a>) which meshes
with the lead-screw,
so that the dial is
revolved by the lead-screw
when the carriage
is stationary,
and when the carriage
is moved by the screw,
the dial remains stationary.
The indicator
is used by engaging
the carriage when
one of the graduation
lines is opposite the
arrow mark; after a
cut is taken the carriage
is returned by
hand and when one of
the graduation lines
again moves opposite
the arrow, the half-nuts are thrown into mesh, as before, and
this is repeated for each successive cut, thus causing the tool to
always come right with the thread. If the number of threads per
inch is even, engagement can be made when any line is opposite
the arrow, but for odd numbers such as 3, 7, 9, 11, etc., one of
the four long or numbered lines must be used. Of course, if the
thread being cut is a multiple of the number on the lead-screw,
engagement can be made at any time, as previously mentioned.</p>

<a name="Secnum_4_5" id="Secnum_4_5"></a><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_142" id="Pg_142">[142]</a></span>
<b>Principle of the Thread Indicator.</b>&mdash;The principle upon
which the thread indicator operates is as follows: The number
of teeth in worm-wheel <i>W</i> is some multiple of the number of
threads per inch of the lead-screw, and the number of teeth in
the worm-wheel, divided by the pitch of the screw, equals the
number of graduations on the dial. For example, if the lead-screw
has six threads per inch, the worm-wheel could have
twenty-four teeth, in which case the dial would have four divisions,
each representing an inch of carriage travel, and by sub-dividing
the dial into eighths (as shown) each line would correspond
to <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub> inch of travel. The dial, therefore, would enable
the carriage to be engaged with the lead-screw at points equal
to a travel of one-half inch. To illustrate the advantage of this
suppose ten threads per inch are being cut and (with the lathe
stationary) the carriage is disengaged and moved <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">6</sub> inch or one
thread on the lead-screw; the tool point will also have moved
<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">6</sub> inch, but it will not be opposite the next thread groove in the
work as the pitch is <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">10</sub> inch. If the carriage is moved another
thread on the lead-screw, or <sup class="enum">2</sup>/<sub class="denom">6</sub> inch, the tool will still be out of
line with the thread on the work, but when it has moved three
threads, or <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub> inch, the tool will then coincide with the original
cut because it has passed over exactly five threads. This would
be true for any number of threads per inch that is divisible by
2. If the thread being cut had nine threads per inch or any
other odd number, the tool would only coincide with the thread
at points 1 inch apart. Therefore, the carriage can only be
engaged when one of the four graduations representing an inch
of travel is opposite the arrow, when cutting odd threads;
whereas even numbers can be &#8220;caught&#8221; by using any one of the
eight lines.</p>

<p>This indicator can also be used for &#8220;catching&#8221; fractional
threads. As an illustration, suppose 11<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub> threads per inch are
to be cut, and the carriage is engaged for the first cut when
graduation line 1 is opposite the arrow; engagement would then
be made for each successive cut, when either line 1 or 3 were
opposite the arrow, or in other words at spaces equal to a carriage
movement of 2 inches. As the use of the indicator when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_143" id="Pg_143">[143]</a></span>
cutting fractional threads is liable to result in error, it is better
to keep the half-nuts in engagement and return the carriage by
reversing the lathe.</p>

<a name="Secnum_4_6" id="Secnum_4_6"></a><p><b>Replacing Sharpened Thread Tool.</b>&mdash;If it is necessary to
sharpen the thread tool before the thread is finished, it should
be reset square with the work by testing with the thread gage
as at <i>B</i>, <a href="#Fig_4_1">Fig. 1</a>. The carriage is then engaged with the lead-screw
and the lathe is turned forward to bring the tool opposite
the partly finished thread and also to take up any backlash or
lost motion in the gears or half-nut. If the tool-point is not
in line with the thread groove previously cut, it can be shifted
sidewise by feeding the compound rest <i>E</i> in or out, provided
the latter is set in an angular position as shown in the plan
view, <a href="#Fig_4_2">Fig. 2</a>.</p>

<p>If the thread tool is ground flat on the top as at <i>A</i>, <a href="#Fig_4_4">Fig. 4</a>, it
is not a good tool for removing metal rapidly as neither of its
two cutting edges has any slope. In order to give each cutting
edge a backward slope, it would be necessary to grind the
top surface hollow or concave, which would be impracticable.
When a course thread is to be cut, a tool shaped as at <i>B</i> can be
used to advantage for rough turning the thread groove, which
is afterward finished to the correct depth and angle by tool <i>A</i>.
This roughing tool is ground with a backward slope from the
point and the latter is rounded to make it stronger.</p>

</div>

<a name="Secnum_4_7" id="Secnum_4_7"></a><p><b>Use of Compound Rest for Thread Cutting.</b>&mdash;Another form
of thread tool is shown at <i>A</i>, <a href="#Fig_4_7">Fig. 7</a>, which is very good for
cutting V-threads especially of coarse pitch. When this tool is
used, the compound rest <i>E</i> is set to an angle of 30 degrees, as
shown, and it is fed in for the successive cuts by handle <i>w</i> in the
direction indicated by the arrow. It will be seen that the point
a of the tool moves at an angle of 60 degrees with the axis of
the work, thus forming one side of the thread, and the cutting
edge <i>a&mdash;b</i>, which can be set as shown at <i>B</i>, forms the opposite
side and does all the cutting. As this edge is given a backward
slope, as shown, it cuts easily and enables threading operations
to be performed quickly. Threads cut in this way are often
finished by taking a light cut with a regular thread tool. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_144" id="Pg_144">[144]</a></span>
cutting edge <i>a&mdash;b</i> is ground to an angle of 60 degrees (or slightly
less, if anything) with the side, as shown by sketch <i>A</i>.</p>

<p>When cutting threads in steel or wrought iron, some sort of
lubricant is usually applied to the tool to preserve the cutting
end and give a smooth finish to the thread. Lard oil or a mixture
of equal parts of lard oil and paraffin oil are often used for this
purpose. If the thread is small, the lubricant may be applied
from an ordinary oil can, but when cutting comparatively large
threads, it is better to have a stream of oil constantly playing
upon the tool-point. This constant flow may be obtained by
mounting a can having a spout leading to the tool, on a bracket
at the rear of the carriage.</p>

</div>

<a name="Secnum_4_8" id="Secnum_4_8"></a><p><b>Threads Commonly Used.</b>&mdash;Three forms of threads or screws
which are in common use are shown in <a href="#Fig_4_8">Fig. 8</a>; these are the
V-thread (<i>A</i>), the U. S. standard (<i>B</i>), and the square thread
(<i>C</i>). The shapes of these threads are shown by the sectioned
parts. The V-thread has straight sides which incline at an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_145" id="Pg_145">[145]</a></span>
angle of 60 degrees with each other and at the same angle with
the axis of the screw. The U. S. standard thread is similar
to the V-thread except that the top of the thread and bottom of
the groove is left flat, as shown, and the width of these flats is
made equal to <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">8</sub> of the pitch. The square thread is square in
section, the width <i>a</i>, depth <i>b</i> and space <i>c</i> being all equal. All
of these threads are right-hand, which means that the grooves
wind around to the right so that a nut will have to be turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_146" id="Pg_146">[146]</a></span>
toward the right to enter it on the thread. A left-hand thread
winds in the other direction, as shown at <i>D</i>, and a nut is screwed
on by turning it to the left.</p>

<a name="Secnum_4_9" id="Secnum_4_9"></a><p><b>Multiple Threads.</b>&mdash;Threads, in addition to being right-and
left-handed, are single, as at <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>, double, as at <i>E</i>,
and triple, as at <i>F</i>, and for certain purposes quadruple threads
or those of a higher multiple are employed. A double thread
is different from a single thread in that it has two grooves,
starting diametrically opposite, whereas a triple thread has three
grooves cut as shown at <i>F</i>. The object of these multiple
threads is to obtain an increase in lead without weakening the
screw. For example, the threads shown at <i>C</i> and <i>E</i> have the
same pitch <i>p</i> but the lead <i>l</i> of the double-threaded screw is
twice that of the one with a single thread so that a nut would
advance twice as far in one revolution, which is often a very
desirable feature. To obtain the same lead with a single thread,
the pitch would have to be double, thus giving a much coarser
thread, which would weaken the screw, unless its diameter
were increased. (The lead is the distance <i>l</i> that one thread advances
in a single turn, or the distance that a nut would advance
in one turn, and it should not be confused with the pitch <i>p</i>,
which is the distance between the centers of adjacent threads.
Obviously the lead and pitch of a single thread are the same.)</p>

<a name="Secnum_4_10" id="Secnum_4_10"></a><p><b>Cutting a U. S. Standard Thread.</b>&mdash;The method of cutting a
U. S. standard thread is the same as described for a V-thread,
so far as handling the lathe is concerned. The thread tool
must correspond, of course, to the shape of a U. S. standard
thread. This tool is first ground to an angle of 60 degrees, as
it would be for cutting a V-thread, and then the point is made
flat as shown in <a href="#Fig_4_9">Fig. 9</a>. As will be recalled, the width of this
flat should be equal to <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">8</sub> of the pitch. By using a gage like the
one shown at <i>G</i>, the tool can easily be ground for any pitch, as
the notches around the periphery of the gage are marked for
different pitches and the tool-point is fitted into the notch corresponding
to the pitch wanted. If such a gage is not available, the
width of the flat at the point can be tested by using, as a gage,
a U. S. standard tap of the same pitch as the thread to be cut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_147" id="Pg_147">[147]</a></span>
When cutting the thread, the tool is set square with the blank,
and a number of successive cuts are taken, the tool being fed
in until the width w of the flat at the top of the thread is equal
to the width at the bottom. The thread will then be the right
size provided the outside diameter <i>D</i> is correct and the tool is
of the correct form. As it would be difficult to measure the
width of this flat accurately, the thread can be tested by screwing
a standard nut over it if a standard thread is being cut. If
it is being fitted to a tapped hole, the tap itself is a very convenient
gage to use, the method being to caliper the tap and
then compare its size with the work.</p>

<p>A good method of cutting a U. S. standard thread to a given
size is as follows: First turn the outside of the blank accurately
to diameter <i>D</i>, and then turn a small part of the end to diameter
<i>r</i> of the thread at the root. The finishing cut for the thread
is then taken with the tool point set to just graze diameter <i>r</i>.
If ordinary calipers were set to diameter <i>r</i> and measurements
taken in the thread groove, the size would be incorrect owing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_148" id="Pg_148">[148]</a></span>
the angularity of the groove, which makes it necessary to hold
the calipers at an angle when measuring. To determine the
root diameter divide 1.299 by the number of threads per inch
and subtract the quotient from the outside diameter. Expressing
this rule as a formula,</p>

<a name="Secnum_4_11" id="Secnum_4_11"></a><p><b>Cutting a Left-hand Thread.</b>&mdash;The only difference between
cutting left-hand and right-hand threads in the lathe is in the
movement of the tool with relation to the work. When cutting
a right-hand thread, the tool moves from right to left, but this
movement is reversed for left-hand threads because the thread
winds around in the opposite direction. To make the carriage
travel from left to right, the lead-screw is rotated backwards
by means of reversing gears <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> (<a href="#Fig_4_10">Fig. 10</a>) located in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_149" id="Pg_149">[149]</a></span>
headstock. Either of these gears can be engaged with the
spindle gear by changing the position of lever <i>R</i>. When gear <i>a</i>
is in engagement, as shown, the drive from the spindle to gear
<i>c</i> is through gears <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, but when lever <i>R</i> is raised thus shifting
<i>b</i> into mesh, the drive is direct and the direction of rotation
is reversed. The thread is cut by starting the tool at <i>a</i>, <a href="#Fig_4_8">Fig. 8</a>,
instead of at the end.</p>

</div>

<a name="Secnum_4_12" id="Secnum_4_12"></a><p><b>Cutting a Square Thread.</b>&mdash;The form of tool used for cutting
a square thread is shown in <a href="#Fig_4_11">Fig. 11</a>. The width <i>w</i> is made
equal to one-half the pitch of the thread to be cut and the end <i>E</i>
is at an angle with the shank, which corresponds to the inclination
<i>x&mdash;y</i> of the threads. This angle <i>A</i> depends upon the
diameter of the screw and the lead of the thread; it can be determined
graphically by drawing a line <i>a&mdash;b</i> equal in length to
the circumference of the screw to be cut, and a line <i>b&mdash;c</i>, at right
angles, equal in length to the lead of the thread. The angle &alpha;
between lines <i>a&mdash;b</i> and <i>a&mdash;c</i> will be the required angle <i>A</i>. (See
end view of thread tool). It is not necessary to have this angle
accurate, ordinarily, as it is simply to prevent the tool from
binding against the sides of the thread. The end of a square
thread tool is shown in section to the right, to illustrate its
position with relation to the threads. The sides <i>e</i> and <i>e<sub>1</sub></i> are
ground to slope inward, as shown, to provide additional clearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_150" id="Pg_150">[150]</a></span>
When cutting multiple threads, which, owing to their increased
lead, incline considerably with the axis of the screw,
the angles for each side of the tool can be determined independently
as follows: Draw line <i>a&mdash;b</i> equal in length to the circumference
of the thread, as before, to obtain the required
angle <i>f</i> of the rear or following side <i>e<sub>1</sub></i>; the angle <i>l</i> of the opposite
or leading side is found by making <i>a&mdash;b</i> equal to the circumference
at the root of the thread. The tool illustrated is for
cutting right-hand threads; if it were intended for a left-hand
thread, the end, of course, would incline in the opposite direction.
The square thread is cut so that the depth <i>d</i> is equal to
the width. When threading a nut for a square thread screw, it
is the usual practice to use a tool having a width slightly greater
than one-half the pitch, to provide clearance for the screw, and
the width of a tool for threading square-thread taps to be used
for tapping nuts is made slightly less than one-half the pitch.</p>

</div>

<a name="Secnum_4_13" id="Secnum_4_13"></a><p><b>Cutting Multiple Threads.</b>&mdash;When a multiple thread is to be
cut, such as a double or triple thread, the lathe is geared with
reference to the number of single threads to the inch. For example,
the lead of the double thread, shown at <i>B</i>, <a href="#Fig_4_12">Fig. 12</a>, is
one-half inch, or twice the pitch, and the number of single
threads to the inch equals 1&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub> = 2. Therefore, the lathe is
geared for cutting two threads per inch. The first cut is taken
just as though a single thread were being cut, leaving the work
as shown at <i>A</i>. When this cut is finished the work is turned
one-half a revolution (for a double thread) without disturbing
the position of the lead-screw or carriage, which brings the tool
midway between the grooves of the single thread as indicated
by dotted lines. The second groove is then cut, producing a
double thread as shown at <i>B</i>. In the case of a triple thread,
the work would be indexed one-third of a revolution after turning
the first groove, and then another third revolution to locate
the tool for cutting the last groove. Similarly, for a quadruple
thread, it would be turned one-quarter revolution after cutting
each successive groove or thread.</p>

<p>There are different methods of indexing the work when
cutting multiple threads, in order to locate the tool in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_151" id="Pg_151">[151]</a></span>
proper position for cutting another thread groove. Some machinists,
when cutting a double thread, simply remove the
work from the lathe and turn it one-half a revolution by placing
the tail of the driving dog in the opposite slot of the faceplate.
This is a very simple method, but if the slots are not
directly opposite or 180 degrees apart, the last thread will not be
central with the first. Another and better method is to disengage
the idler gear from the gear on the stud, turn the spindle
and work one-half, or one-third, of a revolution, as the case
might be, and then connect the gears. For example, if the
stud gear had 96 teeth, the tooth meshing with the idler gear
would be marked with chalk, the gears disengaged, and the
spindle turned until the chalked tooth had made the required
part of a revolution, which could be determined by counting
the teeth. When this method is used, the number of teeth in
the stud gear must be evenly divisible by two if a double thread
is being cut, or by three for a triple thread, etc. If the stud is
not geared to the spindle so that each makes the same number
of revolutions, the ratio of the gearing must be considered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_152" id="Pg_152">[152]</a></span>
<a name="Secnum_4_14" id="Secnum_4_14"></a><b>Setting Tool When Cutting Multiple Threads.</b>&mdash;Another
method, which can sometimes be used for setting the tool after
cutting the first groove of a multiple thread, is to disengage the
lock-nuts from the lead-screw (while the spindle is stationary)
and move the carriage back whatever distance is required to
locate the tool in the proper position for taking the second cut.
Evidently this distance must not only locate the tool in the right
place, but be such that the lock-nuts can be re-engaged with
the lead-screw. Beginning with a simple illustration, suppose a
double thread is being cut having a lead of 1 inch. After the
first thread groove is cut, the tool can be set in a central position
for taking the second cut, by simply moving the carriage back
<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub> inch (one-half the lead), or <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class=
"denom">2</sub> inch plus the lead or any
multiple of the lead. If the length of the threaded part were
5 inches, the tool would be moved back far enough to clear the
end of the work, or say <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;5 = 5<sup class=
"enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub> inches. In order to disengage
the lock-nuts and re-engage them after moving the carriage
5<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub> inches (or any distance equal, in this case, to one-half
plus a whole number), the lead-screw must have an even number
of threads per inch.</p>

<p>Assume that a double thread is being cut having 1<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">4</sub> single
threads per inch. The lead then would equal 1&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;1<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">4</sub> = 0.8
inch, and if the carriage is moved back 0.8&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;2 = 0.4 inch, the
tool will be properly located for the second cut; but the lock-nuts
could not be re-engaged unless the lead-screw had ten
threads per inch, which is finer than the pitch found on the
lead-screws of ordinary engine lathes. However, if the movement
were 0.4 + 0.8&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2 = 2 inches, the lock-nuts could be re-engaged
regardless of the number of threads per inch on the
lead-screw. The rule then, is as follows:</p>

<p><i>Divide the lead of the thread by 2 for a double thread, 3 for a
triple thread, 4 for a quadruple thread, etc., thus obtaining the
pitch; then add the pitch to any multiple of the lead, which will
give a movement, in inches, that will enable the lock-nuts to be re-engaged
with the lead-screw.</i></p>

<p>Whenever the number obtained by this rule is a whole number,
obviously, the movement can be obtained with a lead-screw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_153" id="Pg_153">[153]</a></span>
of any pitch. If the number is fractional, the number of threads
per inch on the lead-screw must be divisible by the denominator
of the fraction.</p>

<p>To illustrate the application of the foregoing rule, suppose a
quadruple thread is to be cut having 1<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub> single threads per inch
(which would be the number the lathe would be geared to cut).
Then the lead of the thread = 1&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;1<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub> = 0.6666 inch and the
pitch = 0.6666&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;4 = 0.1666 inch; adding the pitch to twice
the lead we have 0.1666 + 2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;0.6666 = 1.499 inch. Hence, if
the carriage is moved 1<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub> inch (which will require a lead-screw
having an even number of threads per inch), the tool will be
located accurately enough for practical purposes. When the
tool is set in this way, if it does not clear the end of the part
being threaded, the lathe can be turned backward to place the
tool in the proper position.</p>

<p>The foregoing rule, as applied to triple threads or those of a
higher number, does not always give the only distance that the
carriage can be moved. To illustrate, in the preceding example
the carriage movement could be equal to 0.499, or what is practically
one-half inch, instead of 1<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub> inch, and the tool would be
properly located. The rule, however, has the merit of simplicity
and can be used in most cases.</p>

<p>Special faceplates are sometimes used for multiple thread

One of these is illustrated in <a href="#Fig_4_13">Fig. 13</a>; it consists of two parts <i>A</i>

and <i>B</i>, part <i>A</i> being free to rotate in relation to <i>B</i> when bolts <i>C</i>
are loosened. The driving pin for the lathe dog is attached to
plate <i>A</i>. When one groove of a multiple thread is finished,
bolts <i>C</i> are loosened and plate <i>A</i> is turned around an amount
corresponding to the type of thread being cut. The periphery
of plate <i>A</i> is graduated in degrees, as shown, and for a double
thread it would be turned one-half revolution or 180 degrees,
for a triple thread, 120 degrees, etc. This is a very good arrangement
where multiple thread cutting is done frequently.</p>

<a name="Secnum_4_15" id="Secnum_4_15"></a><p><b>Taper Threading.</b>&mdash;When a taper thread is to be cut, the
tool should be set square with axis <i>a&mdash;a</i> as at <i>A</i>, <a href="#Fig_4_14">Fig. 14</a>, and
not by the tapering surface as at <i>B</i>. If there is a cylindrical
part, the tool can be set as indicated by the dotted lines. All
taper threads should be cut by the use of taper attachments.
If the tailstock is set over to get the required taper, and an
ordinary bent-tail dog is used for driving, the curve of the
thread will not be true, or in other words the thread will not
advance at a uniform rate; this is referred to by machinists as
a &#8220;drunken thread.&#8221; This error in the thread is due to the
angularity between the driving dog and the faceplate, which
causes the work to be rotated at a varying velocity. The pitch
of a taper thread that is cut with the tailstock set over will also
be slightly finer than the pitch for which the lathe is geared.
The amount of these errors depends upon the angle of the taper
and the distance that the center must be offset.</p>

in holes, is an operation performed on work held in the chuck or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_155" id="Pg_155">[155]</a></span>
on a faceplate, as for boring. The tool used is similar to a
boring tool except that the working end is shaped to conform
to the thread to be cut. The method of procedure, when cutting
an internal thread, is similar to that for outside work, as
far as handling the lathe is concerned. The hole to be threaded
is first bored to the root diameter <i>D</i>, <a href="#Fig_4_15">Fig. 15</a>, of the screw that is
to fit into it. The tool-point (of a tool for a U. S. standard or
V-thread) is then set square by holding a gage <i>G</i> against the
true side of the work and adjusting the point to fit the notch in
the gage as shown. The view to the right shows the tool taking
the first cut.</p>

<p>Very often the size of a threaded hole can be tested by using
as a gage the threaded part that is to fit into it. When making
such a test, the tool is, of course, moved back out of the way.
It is rather difficult to cut an accurate thread in a small hole,
especially when the hole is quite deep, owing to the flexibility
of the tool; for this reason threads are sometimes cut slightly
under size with the tool, after which a tap with its shank end
held straight by the tailstock center is run through the hole.
In such a case, the tap should be calipered and the thread made
just small enough with the tool to give the tap a light cut.
Small square-threaded holes are often finished in this way, and
if a number of pieces are to be threaded, the use of a tap makes
the holes uniform in size.</p>

<a name="Secnum_4_17" id="Secnum_4_17"></a><p><b>Stop for Thread Tools.</b>&mdash;When cutting a thread, it is rather
difficult to feed in the tool just the right amount for each successive
cut, because the tool is moved in before it feeds up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_156" id="Pg_156">[156]</a></span>
the work. A stop is sometimes used for threading which overcomes
this difficulty. This stop consists of a screw <i>S</i>, <a href="#Fig_4_16">Fig. 16</a>,
which enters the tool slide and passes through a block <i>B</i> clamped
in front of the slide. The hole in the block through which the
stop-screw passes is not threaded, but is large enough to permit
the screw to move freely. When cutting a thread, the tool is
set for the first cut and the screw is adjusted until the head is
against the fixed block. After taking the first cut, the stop-screw
is backed out, say one-half revolution, which allows the
tool to be fed in far enough for a second cut. If this cut is
about right for depth, the screw is again turned about one-half
revolution for the next cut and this is continued for each successive
cut until the thread is finished. By using a stop of this
kind, there is no danger of feeding the tool in too far as is often
done when the tool is set by guess. If this form of stop is used
for internal threading, the screw, instead of passing through the
fixed block, is placed in the slide so that the end or head will
come against the stop <i>B</i>. This change is made because the tool
is fed outward when cutting an internal thread.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_157" id="Pg_157">[157]</a></span>
0.010 inch to provide clearance and insure a bearing upon the
sides. The thread tool is ordinarily ground to fit a gage having
notches representing different pitches. An improved form of
Acme thread gage is shown in <a href="#Fig_4_17">Fig. 17</a>. The tool point is first
ground to the correct angle by fitting it to the 29-degree notch
in the end of the gage, as at <i>A</i>. The end is then ground to the

the angle between the side and the end can also be tested.</p>

Caliper</p>
</div>

<p>In case it should be necessary to measure the end width of
an Acme thread tool, for a pitch not on the regular gage, this
can be done by using a vernier gear-tooth caliper, as indicated
in <a href="#Fig_4_18">Fig. 18</a>. If we assume that the caliper jaws bear on the sides
of the tool at a distance <i>A</i> from the top, equal to <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">4</sub> inch, then
the width of the tool point equals the caliper reading (as shown
by the horizontal scale) minus 0.1293 inch. For example, if the
caliper reading was 0.315 inch, the width at the point would
equal 0.315 - 0.1293 = 0.1857 inch, assuming that the sides
were ground to the standard angle of 29 degrees. The constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_158" id="Pg_158">[158]</a></span>
to be subtracted from the caliper reading equals 2 <i>A</i> tan 14&deg; 30'
or, in this case, 2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;0.25&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;0.2586 = 0.1293.</p>

<a name="Secnum_4_19" id="Secnum_4_19"></a><p><b>The Whitworth Thread.</b>&mdash;The Whitworth (or British Standard
Whitworth) thread, which is used principally in Great
Britain, has an included angle of 55 degrees, and the threads
are rounded at the top and at the root, as shown in <a href="#Fig_4_23">Fig. 23</a>.
The shape of the tool used for cutting this thread is also shown
in this illustration. The end is rounded to form the fillet at
the root of the thread, and the round corners on the sides give
the top of the thread the required curvature. Every pitch requires
a different tool, and the cutting end is given the curved
form by milling or hobbing. The hob used for this purpose is
accurately threaded to correspond with the pitch for which
the tool is required, and then it is fluted to form cutting edges,
and is hardened. The hob is then used like a milling cutter
for forming the end of the thread tool. The tool is sharpened
by grinding on the top. The method of cutting a Whitworth
thread is, of course, similar to that followed for a U. S. standard
or V-thread, in that the tool is set square with the unthreaded
blank and at the same height as the lathe centers, in order to
secure a thread of the proper form. Care should be taken to
turn the blank to the right diameter so that the top of the
thread will be fully rounded when the screw is the required size.

<b>Worm Threads.</b>&mdash;The standard worm thread has an angle
of 29 degrees between the sides, the same as an Acme thread,
but the depth of a worm thread and the width of the flat at the
top and bottom differ from the Acme standard, as will be seen
by comparing <a href="#Fig_4_21">Figs. 21</a> and <a href="#Fig_4_24">24</a>. The whole depth of the thread
equals the linear pitch multiplied by 0.6866, and the width of
the thread tool at the end equals the linear pitch multiplied by
0.31. Gages notched for threads of different pitch are ordinarily
used when grinding worm thread tools.</p>

<p>When it is necessary to cut multiple-threaded worms of large
lead in an ordinary lathe, difficulty is sometimes experienced
because the lead-screw must be geared to run much faster than
the spindle, thus imposing excessive strains on the gearing.
This difficulty is sometimes overcome by mounting a belt pulley
on the lead-screw, beside the change gear, and connecting
it to the countershaft by a belt; the spindle is then driven
through the change gearing from the lead-screw, instead of <i>vice
versa</i>.</p>

<a name="Secnum_4_21" id="Secnum_4_21"></a><p><b>Coarse Threading Attachment.</b>&mdash;To avoid the difficulties
connected with cutting threads of large lead, some lathes are
equipped with a coarse screw-cutting attachment. The arrangement
of this attachment, as made by the Bradford Machine
Tool Co., is as follows: On the usual reversing shaft, and inside
of the headstock, there is a sliding double gear, so arranged as
to be engaged with either the usual gear on the spindle, or with
a small pinion at the end of the cone. The gears are so proportioned
that the ratio of the two engagements is as 10 to 1;
that is, when engaged with the cone gear (the back-gears being
thrown in) the mating gear will make ten revolutions to one of
the spindle, so that when the lathe is ordinarily geared to cut
one thread per inch, it will, when driven by the cone pinion,
cut one thread in ten inches. This construction dispenses with
the extra strain on the reverse gears due to moving the carriage
at the rapid rate that would be necessary for such a large
lead, when not using an attachment. These attachments are
not only extensively used for the cutting of coarse screws but
for cutting oil grooves on cylindrical parts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_161" id="Pg_161">[161]</a></span>When cutting a thread
of large lead or &#8220;steep pitch,&#8221; the top
of the thread tool should be ground so that it is at right angles
to the thread; then the thread groove will be cut to the same
width as the tool.</p>

<a name="Secnum_4_22" id="Secnum_4_22"></a><p><b>Testing the Size of a Thread.</b>&mdash;When the thread tool has
been fed in far enough to form a complete thread, the screw is
then tested for size. If we assume that a bolt is being threaded
for a standard nut, it would be removed from the lathe and the
test made by screwing a nut on the end. If the thread were
too large, the nut might screw on very tightly or not at all; in
either case, the work would again be placed in the lathe and a
light cut taken over it to reduce the thread to the proper size.
When replacing a threaded part between the centers, it should
be put back in the original position, that is, with the &#8220;tail&#8221; of
the driving dog in the same slot of the faceplate it previously
occupied.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 25. Testing Diameter of Thread with Calipers and Micrometer</p>
</div>

<p>As it is difficult to tell just when a thread is cut to the exact
size, special thread calipers having wedge-shaped ends are
sometimes used for measuring the diameter of a V-thread or a
U. S. standard thread, at the bottom of the grooves or the root
diameter, as shown at <i>A</i> in <a href="#Fig_4_25">Fig. 25</a>. These calipers can be set
from a tap corresponding to the size of the thread being cut, or
from a previously threaded piece of the right size.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_162" id="Pg_162">[162]</a></span>
<a name="Secnum_4_23" id="Secnum_4_23"></a><b>The Thread Micrometer.</b>&mdash;Another form of caliper for testing
threads is shown at <i>B</i>. This is one of the micrometer type
and is intended for very accurate work. The spindle of this
micrometer has a conical end and the &#8220;anvil&#8221; is V-shaped,
and these ends bear on the sides of the thread or the surfaces
which form the bearing when the screw is inserted in a nut or
threaded hole. The cone-shaped point is slightly rounded so
that it will not bear in the bottom of the thread. There is also
sufficient clearance at the bottom of the V-shaped anvil to prevent
it from bearing on top of the thread. The diameter as
indicated by this micrometer is the &#8220;pitch diameter&#8221; of the
thread and is equal to the outside diameter minus the depth of
one thread. This depth may be determined as follows:</p>

<p class="ind05">Depth of a V-thread = 0.866&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;No. of threads per inch;</p>

<p class="ind05">Depth of a U. S. standard thread = 0.6495&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;No. of threads
per inch;</p>

<p class="ind05">Depth of Whitworth thread = 0.6403&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;No. of threads per inch.</p>

<p>The movable point measures all pitches, but the fixed anvil
is limited in its capacity, for if made large enough to measure a
thread of, say, <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">4</sub>-inch pitch, it would be too wide at the top to
measure a thread of <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">24</sub>-inch pitch, hence each caliper is limited
in the range of threads that the anvil can measure. When
measuring the &#8220;angle diameter&#8221; of a thread, the micrometer
should be passed back and forth across the thread, in order to
make sure that the largest dimension or the actual diameter is
being measured. If the micrometer is placed over what seems
to be the center of the screw and the reading is taken by simply
adjusting in the anvil or point against the thread, without moving
the micrometer back and forth across it, an incorrect reading
may be obtained.</p>

<p>If standard threaded reference gages are available, the size
of the thread being cut can be tested by comparing it with the
gage. Micrometers having small spherical measuring ends (see
sketch <i>A</i>, <a href="#Fig_4_26">Fig. 26</a>) are sometimes used for this purpose. The
ball points are small enough to bear against the sides of the
thread and the diameter, as compared with the reference gage,
can be determined with great accuracy.</p>

<a name="Secnum_4_24" id="Secnum_4_24"></a><b>Three-wire System of Measuring Threads.</b>&mdash;A method of
measuring threads by using an ordinary micrometer and three
wires of equal diameter is illustrated at <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, <a href="#Fig_4_26">Fig. 26</a>. Two
wires are placed between the threads on one side and one on the
opposite side of the screw. The dimension <i>M</i> over the wires is
then measured with an ordinary micrometer. When the thread
is cut to a standard size, the dimension <i>M</i> for different threads
is as follows:</p>

<p>For a U. S. standard thread:</p>

<p class="ind05"><i>m</i> = <i>d</i> - 1.5155<i>p</i> + 3<i>w</i></p>

<p>For a sharp V-thread:</p>

<p class="ind05"><i>m</i> = <i>d</i> - 1.732<i>p</i> + 3<i>w</i></p>

<p>For a Whitworth standard thread:</p>

<p class="ind05"><i>m</i> = <i>d</i> - 1.6008<i>p</i> + 3.1657<i>w</i></p>

<p>In these formulas, <i>d</i> = standard outside diameter of screw;
<i>m</i> = measurement over wires; <i>w</i> = diameter of wires; <i>p</i> =
pitch of thread = 1&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;number of threads per inch.</p>

<p>To illustrate the use of the formula for the U. S. standard
thread, let us assume that a screw having 6 threads per inch
(<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">6</sub>-inch pitch) is to be cut to a diameter of 1<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub
class="denom">2</sub> inch, and that wires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_164" id="Pg_164">[164]</a></span>
0.140 inch diameter are to be used in conjunction with a micrometer
for measurement. Then the micrometer reading <i>m</i> should
be</p>

<p class="ind05">1<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub> - 1.5155&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub
class="denom">6</sub> + 3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;0.140 = 1.6674 inch</p>

<p>If the micrometer reading were 1.670 inch, it would indicate
that the pitch diameter of the screw was too large, the error
being equal to difference between 1.667 and the actual reading.</p>

</div>

<a name="Secnum_4_25" id="Secnum_4_25"></a><p><b>Rivett-Dock Threading Tool.</b>&mdash;A special form of thread tool,
which overcomes a number of disadvantages common to an
ordinary single-point thread tool, is shown in <a href="#Fig_4_27">Fig. 27</a>. This
tool has a circular-shaped cutter <i>C</i>, having ten teeth around its
circumference, which, beginning with tooth No. 1, gradually increase
in height, cutter No. 2 being higher than No. 1, etc.
This cutter is mounted on a slide <i>S</i>, that is fitted to the frame
<i>F</i>, and can be moved in or out by lever <i>L</i>. The hub of this lever
has an eccentric stud which moves slide <i>S</i> and locks it when
in the forward or cutting position. The action of the lever in
moving the slide engages the cutter with pawl <i>P</i>, thus rotating
the cutter one tooth at a time and presenting a different tooth
to the work for each movement of the lever. When the slide is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_165" id="Pg_165">[165]</a></span>
moved forward, the heel or underside of the tooth which is in
the working position rests on a stop that takes the thrust of
the cut.</p>

<p>When the tool is in use, it is mounted on the tool-block of the
lathe as shown in the illustration. The cutter is set for height
by placing a tooth in the working position and setting the top
level with the lathe center. The cutter is also set square with
the work by using an ordinary square, and it is tilted slightly
from the vertical to correspond with the angle of the thread to
be cut, by adjusting frame <i>F</i>. At first a light cut is taken with
lever <i>L</i> moved forward and tooth No. 1 on the stop. After
this cut is completed, the lever is reversed which rotates the
cutter one tooth, and the return movement places tooth No. 2
in the working position. This operation is repeated until the
tenth tooth finishes the thread. It is often necessary, when
using a single-point thread tool, to re-sharpen it before taking
the finishing cut, but with a circular tool this is not necessary,
for by using the different teeth successively, the last tooth,
which only takes finishing cuts, is kept in good condition.</p>

<a name="Secnum_4_26" id="Secnum_4_26"></a><p><b>Cutting Screws to Compensate for Shrinkage.</b>&mdash;Some tool
steels are liable to shrink more or less when they are hardened;
consequently if a very accurate hardened screw is required, it is
sometimes cut so that the pitch is slightly greater than standard,
to compensate for the shrinkage due to the hardening
operation. As the amount of contraction incident to hardening
is very little, it is not practicable to use change gears that will
give the exact pitch required. A well-known method of obtaining
this increase of pitch is by the use of a taper attachment.</p>

<a name="Fig_4_28" id="Fig_4_28"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><div class="illobox450"><img src="images/174sm.png" alt="Diagram Illustrating Method of Cutting a Thread to Compensate for the Error in Pitch due to Shrinkage in Hardening" /></div>
<p class="caption750">Fig. 28. Diagram Illustrating Method of Cutting a Thread to<br />Compensate for the Error in Pitch
due to Shrinkage in Hardening</p>
</div>

<p>For example, suppose a tap having 8 threads per inch is to be
threaded, and, owing to the contraction of the steel, the pitch
must be 0.12502 inch instead of 0.125 inch. The lathe is geared
to cut 8 threads per inch or 0.125 inch pitch, and then the
taper attachment is set to an angle <i>a</i>, <a href="#Fig_4_28">Fig. 28</a>, the cosine of
which equals 0.125&divide;0.12502; that is, the cosine of angle <i>a</i> equals <i>the
pitch required after hardening</i>, divided by the <i>pitch necessary to
compensate for shrinkage</i>. The angle is then found by referring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_166" id="Pg_166">[166]</a></span>
to a table of cosines. The tap blank is also set to the same
angle a by adjusting the tailstock center, thus locating the axis
of the work parallel with the slide of the taper attachment.
When the carriage moves a distance <i>x</i>, the tool point will have
moved a greater distance <i>y</i> along the work, the difference between
x and y depending upon angle <i>a</i>; hence the tool will cut
a thread of slightly greater pitch than the lathe is geared to cut.</p>

<p>To illustrate by using the preceding example, cosine of angle
<i>a</i> = 0.125&divide;0.12502 = 0.99984. By referring to a table of cosines, we
find that 0.99984 is the cosine of 1 degree, approximately;
hence, the taper attachment slide and the work should be set
to this angle. (The angle <i>a</i> in <a href="#Fig_4_28">Fig. 28</a> has been exaggerated in
order to more clearly illustrate the principle.)</p>

<p>As is well known, it is objectionable to cut a thread with the
tailstock center offset, because the work is not rotated at a
uniform velocity, owing to the fact that the driving dog is at an
angle with the faceplate. For a small angle such as 1 degree,
however, the error resulting from this cause would be very
small.</p>

<p>If a thread having a pitch slightly less than standard is
needed to fit a threaded part which has contracted in hardening,
the taper attachment can also be used provided the lathe
is equipped with special gears to cut a little less than the required
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_167" id="Pg_167">[167]</a></span>
pitch. Suppose a screw having a pitch of 0.198 inch is
required to fit the thread of a nut the pitch of which has been
reduced from 0.200 inch to 0.198 inch. If gears having 83 and
84 teeth are available, these can be inserted in a compound
train, so as to reduce the 0.200 inch pitch that would be obtained
with the regular gearing, to <sup class="enum">83</sup>/<sub class="denom">84</sub> of 0.200 or 0.19762 inch.
This pitch, which is less than the 0.198 inch pitch required, is
then increased by using the taper attachment as previously described.
(This method was described by Mr. G. H. Gardner
in <span class="smcap">Machinery</span>, February, 1914.)</p>

<a name="Secnum_4_27" id="Secnum_4_27"></a><p><b>Calculating Change Gears for Thread Cutting.</b>&mdash;As previously
mentioned, the change gears for cutting threads of various
pitches are shown by a table or &#8220;index plate&#8221; attached to
the lathe. The proper gears to be used can be calculated, but
the use of the table saves time and tends to avoid mistakes.
Every machinist, however, should know how to determine the
size of gears used for cutting any number of threads to the
inch. Before referring to any rules, let us first consider why a
lathe cuts a certain number of threads to the inch and how this
number is changed by the use of different gears.</p>

<a name="Fig_4_29" id="Fig_4_29"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><div class="illobox450"><img src="images/176sm.png" alt="Lathe with Simple Gearing for Thread Cutting, Compound Geared Lathe" /></div>
<p class="caption750">Fig. 29. (A) Lathe with Simple Gearing for Thread Cutting.<br />(B) Compound Geared Lathe</p>
</div>

<p>As the carriage <i>C</i> and the tool are moved by the lead-screw
<i>S</i> (see <a href="#Fig_4_2">Fig. 2</a>), which is geared to the spindle, the number of
threads to the inch that are cut depends, in every case, upon the
number of turns the work makes while the lead-screw is moving
the carriage one inch. If the lead-screw has six threads per
inch, it will make six revolutions while the carriage and the
thread tool travel one inch along the piece to be threaded.
Now if the change gears <i>a</i> and <i>c</i> (see also sketch <i>A</i>, <a href="#Fig_4_29">Fig. 29</a>) are
so proportioned that the spindle makes the same number of
revolutions as the lead-screw, in a given time, it is evident that
the tool will cut six threads per inch. If the spindle revolved
twice as fast as the lead-screw, it would make twelve turns
while the tool moved one inch, and, consequently, twelve threads
per inch would be cut; but to get this difference in speeds it is
necessary to use a combination of gearing that will cause the
lead-screw to revolve once while the lathe spindle and work
make two revolutions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_168" id="Pg_168">[168]</a></span>Suppose that nine threads to the inch are to be cut and the
lead-screw has six threads per inch. In this case the work must
make nine revolutions while the lead-screw makes six and causes
the carriage and thread tool to move one inch, or in other words,
one revolution of the lead-screw corresponds to one and one-half
revolution of the spindle; therefore, if the lead-screw gear
<i>c</i> has 36 teeth, the gear <i>a</i> on the spindle stud should have
24 teeth. The spindle will then revolve one and one-half times
faster than the lead-screw, provided the stud rotates at the
same rate of speed as the main lathe spindle. The number of
teeth in the change gears that is required for a certain pitch
can be found by multiplying the number of threads per inch of
the lead-screw, and the number of threads per inch to be cut,
by the same trial multiplier. The formula which expresses the
relation between threads per inch of lead-screw, threads per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_169" id="Pg_169">[169]</a></span>
inch to be cut, and the number of teeth in the change gears, is
as follows:</p>

<table class="formula" summary="Formula 169_1">
<tr><td>&nbsp;threads per inch of lead-screw</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;teeth in gear on spindle stud&nbsp;</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;threads per inch to be cut&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;teeth in gear on lead-screw&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Applying this to the example given, we have 6&divide;9 = 24&divide;36. The
values of 36 and 24 are obtained by multiplying 6 and 9, respectively,
by 4, which, of course, does not change the proportion.
Any other number could be used as a multiplier, and if gears
having 24 and 36 teeth were not available, this might be necessary.
For example, if there were no gears of this size, some
other multiplier as 5 or 6 might be used.</p>

<p>Suppose the number of teeth in the change gears supplied
with the lathe are 24, 28, 32, 36, etc., increasing by four teeth
up to 100, and assume that the lead-screw has 6 threads per
inch and that 10 threads per inch are to be cut. Then,</p>

<p>By multiplying both numerator and denominator by 4, we
obtain two available gears having 24 and 40 teeth, respectively.
The 24-tooth gear goes on the spindle stud and, the 40-tooth gear
on the lead-screw. The number of teeth in the intermediate or
&#8220;idler&#8221; gear <i>b</i>, which connects the stud and lead-screw gears, is
not considered as it does not affect the ratios between gears <i>a</i>
and <i>c</i>, but is used simply to transmit motion from one gear to
the other.</p>

<p>We have assumed in the foregoing that the spindle stud (on
which gear <i>a</i> is mounted) and the main spindle of the lathe are
geared in the ratio of one to one and make the same number of
revolutions. In some lathes, however, these two members do
not rotate at the same speed, so that if equal gears were placed
on the lead-screw and spindle stud, the spindle would not make
the same number of revolutions as the lead-screw. In that case
if the actual number of threads per inch in the lead-screw were
used when calculating the change gears, the result would be
incorrect; hence, to avoid mistakes, the following general rule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_170" id="Pg_170">[170]</a></span>
should be used as it gives the correct result, regardless of the
ratios of the gears which connect the spindle and spindle stud:</p>

<p><i>Rule.&mdash;First find the number of threads per inch that is cut
when gears of the same size are placed on the lead-screw and spindle,
either by actual trial or by referring to the index plate. Then
place this number as the numerator of a fraction and the number
of threads per inch to be cut, as the denominator; multiply both
numerator and denominator by some trial number, until numbers
are obtained which correspond to numbers of teeth in gears that are
available.</i> The product of the trial number and the numerator
(or &#8220;lathe screw constant&#8221;) represents the gear <i>a</i> for the spindle
stud, and the product of the trial number and the denominator,
the gear for the lead-screw.</p>

as shown at <i>A</i>, <a href="#Fig_4_29">Fig. 29</a>, it is referred to as simple gearing, but
sometimes it is necessary to introduce two gears between the
stud and screw as at <i>B</i>, which is termed compound gearing.
The method of figuring compound gearing is practically the same
as that for simple gearing. To find the change gears used in
compound gearing, place the &#8220;screw constant&#8221; obtained by the
foregoing rule, as the numerator, and the number of threads per
inch to be cut as the denominator of a fraction; resolve both
numerator and denominator into two factors each, and multiply
each &#8220;pair&#8221; of factors by the same number, until values are
obtained representing numbers of teeth in available change
gears. (One factor in the numerator and one in the denominator
make a &#8220;pair&#8221; of factors.)</p>

<p>Suppose the lathe cuts 6 threads per inch when gears of equal
size are used, and that the number of teeth in the gears available
are 30, 35, 40 and so on, increasing by 5 up to 100. If 24
threads per inch are to be cut, the screw constant 6 is placed in
the numerator and 24 in the denominator. The numerator and
denominator are then divided into factors and each pair of
factors is multiplied by the same number to find the gears,
thus:</p>

inch corresponding to the given lead in millimeters. Suppose a
thread of 3 millimeters lead is to be cut in a lathe having an
English lead-screw and a screw constant of 6. As there are
25.4 millimeters per inch, the number of threads per inch will
equal 25.4&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;3. Place the screw constant as the numerator,
and the number of threads per inch to be cut as the denominator:</p>

<p>The numerator and denominator of this fractional expression
of the change-gear ratio are next multiplied by some trial number
to determine the size of the gears. The first whole number
by which 25.4 can be multiplied so as to get a whole number as
the result is 5. Thus, 25.4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;5 = 127; hence, one gear having
127 teeth is always used when cutting metric threads with
an English lead-screw. The other gear required in this case
has 90 teeth. Thus:</p>

<p>Therefore, the following rule can be used to find the change
gears for cutting metric pitches with an English lead-screw:</p>

<p><i>Rule.&mdash;Place the lathe screw constant multiplied by the lead of
the required thread in millimeters multiplied by 5, as the numerator
of the fraction, and 127 as the denominator. The product of the
numbers in the numerator equals the number of teeth for the spindle-stud
gear, and 127 is the number of teeth for the lead-screw gear.</i></p>

<p>If the lathe has a metric pitch lead-screw, and a screw having
a given number of threads per inch is to be cut, first find the
&#8220;metric screw constant&#8221; of the lathe or the lead of thread in
millimeters that would be cut with change gears of equal size
on the lead-screw and spindle stud; then the method of determining
the change gears is simply the reverse of the one already
explained for cutting a metric thread with an English lead-screw.</p>

<p><i>Rule.&mdash;To find the change gears for cutting English threads
with a metric lead-screw, place 127 in the numerator and the threads
per inch to be cut, multiplied by the metric screw constant multiplied</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_173" id="Pg_173">[173]</a></span>

much used at the present time is shown in <a href="#Fig_4_30">Fig. 30</a>. This is
known as the quick change-gear type, because it has a system
of gearing which makes it unnecessary to remove the change
gears and replace them with different sizes for cutting threads
of various pitches. Changes of feed are also obtained by the
same mechanism, but the feeding movement is transmitted to
the carriage by the rod <i>R</i>, whereas the screw <i>S<sub>1</sub></i> is used for screw
cutting. As previously explained, the idea of using the screw exclusively
for threading is to prevent it from being worn excessively,
as it would be if continually used in place of rod <i>R</i>, for
feeding the carriage when turning.</p>

</div>

<p>The general construction of this quick change gear mechanism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_175" id="Pg_175">[175]</a></span>
and the way the changes are made for cutting threads of different
pitch, will be explained in connection with <a href="#Fig_4_30">Figs. 30</a>, <a href="#Fig_4_31">31</a> and
<a href="#Fig_4_32">32</a>, which are marked with the same reference letters for corresponding
parts. Referring to <a href="#Fig_4_30">Fig. 30</a>, the movement is transmitted
from gear <i>s</i> on the spindle stud through idler gear <i>I</i>,
which can be moved sidewise to mesh with either of the three
gears <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> or <i>c</i>, <a href="#Fig_4_31">Fig. 31</a>. This cone of three gears engages gears
<i>d</i>, <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>, any one of which can be locked with shaft <i>T</i> (<a href="#Fig_4_32">Fig.
32</a>) by changing the position of knob <i>K</i>. On shaft <i>T</i> there is
a gear <i>S</i> which can be moved along the shaft by hand lever <i>L</i>
and, owing to the spline or key <i>t</i>, both the sliding gear and shaft
rotate together. Shaft <i>T</i>, carrying gears <i>d</i>, <i>e</i> and <i>f</i> and the
sliding gear <i>S</i>, is mounted in a yoke <i>Y</i>, which can be turned
about shaft <i>N</i>, thus making it possible to lower sliding gear <i>S</i>
into mesh with any one of a cone of eight gears <i>C</i>, <a href="#Fig_4_31">Fig. 31</a>. The
shaft on which the eight gears are mounted has at the end a
small gear <i>m</i> meshing with gear <i>n</i> on the feed-rod, and the latter,
in turn, drives the lead-screw, unless gear <i>o</i> is shifted to the
right out of engagement, which is its position except when
cutting threads.</p>

<a name="Fig_4_32" id="Fig_4_32"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><div class="illobox450"><img src="images/183sm.png" alt="Sectional Views of Quick Change-gear Mechanism" /></div>
<p class="caption750">Fig. 32. Sectional Views of Quick Change-gear Mechanism</p>
</div>

<p>With this mechanism, eight changes for different threads or
feeds are obtained by simply placing gear <i>S</i> into mesh with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_176" id="Pg_176">[176]</a></span>
various sized gears in cone <i>C</i>. As the speed of shaft <i>T</i> depends
on which of the three gears <i>d</i>, <i>e</i> and <i>f</i> are locked to it, the eight
changes are tripled by changing the position of knob <i>K</i>, making
twenty-four. Now by shifting idler gear <i>I</i>, three speed changes
may be obtained for gears <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, which rotate together, so
that the twenty-four changes are also tripled, giving a total of
seventy-two variations without
removing any gears, and if a
different sized gear <i>s</i> were placed
on the spindle stud, an entirely
different range could be obtained,
but such a change would
rarely be necessary. As shown
in <a href="#Fig_4_30">Fig. 30</a>, there are eight hardened
steel buttons <i>B</i>, or one for
each gear of the cone <i>C</i>, placed
at different heights in the casing.
When lever <i>L</i> is shifted sidewise
to change the position of sliding
gear <i>S</i>, it is lowered onto one
of these buttons (which enters a
pocket on the under side) and in
this way gear <i>S</i> is brought into
proper mesh with any gear of the
cone <i>C</i>. To shift lever <i>L</i>, the
handle is pulled outward against
the tension of spring <i>r</i> (<a href="#Fig_4_32">Fig. 32</a>),
which disengages latch <i>l</i> and enables
the lever to be lifted clear of the button; yoke <i>Y</i> is then
raised or lowered, as the case may be, and lever <i>L</i> with the
sliding gear is shifted laterally to the required position.</p>

<p>The position of lever <i>L</i> and knob <i>K</i> for cutting threads of
different pitches is shown by an index plate or table attached
to the lathe and arranged as shown in <a href="#Fig_4_33">Fig. 33</a>. The upper
section <i>a</i> of this table shows the different numbers of threads to
the inch that can be obtained when idler gear <i>I</i> is in the position
shown by the diagram <i>A</i>. Section <i>b</i> gives the changes when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_177" id="Pg_177">[177]</a></span>
the idler gear is moved, as shown at <i>B</i>, and, similarly, section
<i>c</i> gives the changes for position <i>C</i> of the idler. The horizontal
row of figures from 1 to 8 below the word &#8220;stops&#8221; represents
the eight positions for lever <i>L</i>, which has a plate <i>p</i> (<a href="#Fig_4_30">Fig. 30</a>) just
beneath it with corresponding numbers, and the column to the
left shows whether knob <i>K</i> should be out, in a central position,
or in.</p>

<p>In order to find what the position of lever <i>L</i> and knob <i>K</i>
should be for cutting any given number of threads to the inch,
find what &#8220;stop&#8221; number is directly above the number of threads
to be cut, which will indicate the location of lever <i>L</i>, and also what
position should be occupied by knob <i>K</i>, as shown in the column
to the left. For example, suppose the lathe is to be geared for
cutting eight threads to the inch. By referring to section a we
see that lever <i>L</i> should be in position 4 and knob <i>K</i> in the center,
provided the idler gear <i>I</i> were in position <i>A</i>, as it would be
ordinarily, because all standard numbers of threads per inch
(U. S. standard) from <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">4</sub> inch up to and including 4 inches in
diameter can be cut with the idler gear in that position. As
another illustration, suppose we want to cut twenty-eight threads
per inch. This is listed in section <i>c</i>, which shows that lever <i>L</i>
must be placed in position 3 with knob <i>K</i> pushed in and the
idler gear shifted to the left as at <i>C</i>.</p>

<p>The simplicity of this method as compared with the time-consuming
operation of removing and changing gears is apparent.
The diagram <i>D</i> to the right shows an arrangement of
gearing for cutting nineteen threads per inch. A 20-tooth gear
is placed on the spindle stud (in place of the regular one having
16 teeth) and one with 95 teeth on the lead-screw, thus driving
the latter direct as with ordinary change gears. Of course it
will be understood that the arrangement of a quick change-gear
mechanism varies somewhat on lathes of different make.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapnum_5" id="Chapnum_5">CHAPTER V</a></h2>
<h3>TURRET LATHE PRACTICE</h3>
<hr class="c05" />

<p>Turret lathes are adapted for turning duplicate parts in quantity.
The characteristic feature of a turret lathe is the turret
which is mounted upon a carriage and contains the tools which
are successively brought into the working position by indexing
or rotating the turret. In many instances, all the tools required
can be held in the turret, although it is often necessary to use
other tools, held on a cross-slide, for cutting off the finished
part, facing a radial surface, knurling, or for some other operation.
After a turret lathe is equipped with the tools needed
for machining a certain part, it produces the finished work much
more rapidly than would be possible by using an ordinary engine
lathe, principally because each tool is carefully set for turning
or boring to whatever size is required and the turret makes it
possible to quickly place any tool in the working position. Turret
lathes also have systems of stops or gages for controlling the
travel of the turret carriage and cross-slide, in order to regulate
the depth of a bored hole, the length of a cylindrical part or its
diameter; hence, turning machines of this type are much more
efficient than ordinary lathes for turning duplicate parts, unless
the quantity is small, in which case, the advantage of the turret
lathe might be much more than offset by the cost of the special
tool equipment and the time required for &#8220;setting up&#8221; the
machine. (See &#8220;<a href="#Secnum_5_32">Selecting Type of Turning Machine</a>.&#8221;)</p>

</div>

<a name="Secnum_5_1" id="Secnum_5_1"></a><p><b>General Description of a Turret Lathe.</b>&mdash;The turret lathe
shown in <a href="#Fig_5_1">Fig. 1</a> has a hexagonal shaped turret <i>A</i> with a hole in
each side in which the tools are held. This turret is mounted on
a slide <i>B</i> which is carried by a saddle <i>C</i> that can be moved along
the bed to locate the turret slide with reference to the length of
the tools in the turret and the room required for indexing. The
turret slide can be moved longitudinally by turning the pilot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_180" id="Pg_180">[180]</a></span>
wheel or turnstile <i>D</i>, or it can be fed by power. Ordinarily,
the hand adjustment is used for quickly moving the carriage
when the tools are not cutting, although sometimes the hand
feed is preferable to a power feed when the tools are at work,
especially if the cuts are short. After a turret tool has finished
its cut, the turnstile is used to return the slide to the starting
point, and at the end of this backward movement the turret
is automatically indexed or turned one-sixth of a revolution,
thus bringing the next tool into the working position. The
turret is accurately located in each of its six positions by a lock
bolt which engages notches formed in a large index ring at the
turret base. A binder lever <i>E</i> at the top of the turret stud is
used to clamp the turret rigidly to the slide when the tools are
cutting.</p>

<p>The forward movement of the slide for each position of the
turret is controlled by stops at <i>F</i>, which are set to suit the work
being turned. When parts are being turned from bar stock, the
latter passes through the hollow spindle of the headstock and
extends just far enough beyond the end of the spindle to permit
turning one of the parts. The bar is held while the turning tools
are at work, by a chuck of the collet type at <i>G</i>. This chuck is
opened or closed around the bar by turning handwheel <i>H</i>. After
a finished part has been cut off by a tool held in cross-slide <i>J</i>,
the chuck is released and further movement of wheel <i>H</i> causes
ratchet feed dog <i>K</i>, and the bar which passes through it, to
be drawn forward. This forward movement is continued until
the end of the bar comes against a stop gage held in one of the
turret holes, to insure feeding the bar out just the right amount
for turning the next piece. On some turret lathes, the lever
which operates the chuck also controls a power feed for the
bar stock, the latter being pushed through the spindle against
the stop.</p>

<p>The machine illustrated has a power feed for the cross-slide
as well as for the turret. The motion is obtained from the same
shaft <i>L</i> which actuates the turret slide, but the feed changes
are independent. The cross-slide feed changes are varied by
levers <i>M</i> and those for the turret by levers <i>N</i>. For many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_181" id="Pg_181">[181]</a></span>
turret lathe operations, such as turning castings, etc., a jawed
chuck is screwed onto the spindle and the work is held the same
as when a chuck is used on an engine lathe. Sometimes chucks
are used having special jaws for holding castings of irregular
shape, or special work-holding fixtures which are bolted to the
faceplate. The small handle at <i>O</i> is for moving the cross-slide
along the bed when this is necessary in order to feed a tool
sidewise.</p>

<p>This particular machine is driven by a motor at the rear of
the headstock, connection being made with the spindle through
gearing. The necessary speed changes are obtained both by
varying the speed of the motor and by shifting gears in the
headstock. The motor is controlled by the turnstile <i>P</i> and the
gears are shifted by the vertical levers shown.</p>

<p>While many of the features referred to are common to turret
lathes in general, it will be understood that the details such as
the control levers, arrangement of stops, etc., vary on turret
lathes of different make.</p>

<a name="Secnum_5_2" id="Secnum_5_2"></a><p><b>Example of Turret Lathe Work.</b>&mdash;The diagrams <a href="#Fig_5_2">Figs. 2</a> and
<a href="#Fig_5_3">3</a> show a turret lathe operation which is typical in many respects.
The part to be turned is a hub casting for an automobile and it
is machined in two series of operations. The first series is shown
by the plan view, <a href="#Fig_5_2">Fig. 2</a>. The casting <i>A</i> is held in a three-jaw
chuck <i>B</i>. Tool No. 1 on the cross-slide is equipped with two
cutters and rough faces the flange and end, while the inner and
outer surfaces of the cylindrical part are rough bored and turned
by combination boring and turning tool No. 2. This tool has,
in addition to a regular boring-bar, a bracket or tool-holder
which projects above the work and carries cutters that operate
on the top surface. Tools Nos. 3 and 4 next come into action,
No. 3 finishing the surfaces roughed out by No. 2, and No. 4
finish-facing the flange and end of the hub. The detailed side
view of Tool No. 3 (which is practically the same as No. 2),
shows the arrangement of the cutters <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>, one of which
turns the cylindrical surface and the other bevels the end of
the hub. The hole in the hub is next finished by tool No. 5
which is a stepped reamer that machines the bore and counterbore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_183" id="Pg_183">[183]</a></span>
to the required size within very close limits. The surfaces
machined by the different tools referred to are indicated by
the sectional view <i>E</i> of the hub, which shows by the numbers
what tools are used on each surface.</p>

<p>For the second series of operations, the position of the hub
is reversed and it is held in a spring or collet type of chuck as
shown by the plan view <a href="#Fig_5_3">Fig. 3</a>. The finished cylindrical end
of the hub is inserted in the split collet <i>F</i> which is drawn back
into the tapering collet ring by rod <i>G</i> (operated by turnstile <i>H</i>,
<a href="#Fig_5_1">Fig. 1</a>) thus closing the collet tightly around the casting. The
first operation is that of facing the side of the flange and end of
the hub with tool No. 6 on the cross-slide, which is shown in the
working position. A broad cutter <i>H</i> is used for facing the
flange and finishing the large fillet, and the end is faced by a
smaller cutter <i>I</i>. When these tools are withdrawn, tool No. 7
is moved up for rough turning the outside of the cylindrical end
(preparatory to cutting a thread) and rough boring the hole.
These same surfaces are then finished by tool No. 8. The arrangement
of tools Nos. 7 and 8 is shown by the detailed view.
Tool <i>J</i> turns the part to be threaded; tool <i>K</i> turns the end beyond
the threaded part; and tool <i>L</i> bevels the corner or edge.
The reaming tool No. 9 is next indexed to the working position
for finishing the hole and beveling the outer edge slightly. At
the same time, the form tool No. 10, held at the rear of the cross-slide,
is fed up for beveling the flange to an angle of 60 degrees.
The final operation is that of threading the end, which is done
with die No. 11. The boring-bars of tools Nos. 2, 3, 7 and 8
are all provided with pilots <i>N</i> which enter close fitting bushings
held in the spindle, to steady the bar while taking the
cut. This is a common method of supporting turret lathe
tools.</p>

<p>The feed of the turret for both the first and second series of
operations is <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">27</sub> inch per revolution and the speeds 60 revolutions
per minute for the roughing cuts and 90 revolutions per
minute for the finishing cuts. The total time for machining
one of these castings complete is about 7<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub> minutes, which includes
the time required for placing the work in the chuck.</p>

<a name="Secnum_5_3" id="Secnum_5_3"></a><b>Machining Flywheels in Turret Lathe.</b>&mdash;<a href="#Fig_5_4">Figs. 4</a>
to <a href="#Fig_5_6">6</a>, inclusive,illustrate how a gasoline engine flywheel is finished all over in
two cycles of operations. First the flywheel is turned complete
on one side, the hole bored and reamed, and the outside of the
rim finished; in the second cycle the other side of the flywheel
is completed.</p>

<p>During the first operation, the work is held by the inside of
the rim by means of a four-jaw chuck equipped with hard jaws.
The side of the rim, the tapering circumference of the recess,
the web, and the hub are first rough-turned, using tools held in
the carriage toolpost. The hole is then rough-bored by bar <i>C</i>,
which is supported in a bushing in the chuck, as shown in <a href="#Fig_5_4">Fig. 4.</a>
The outside of the wheel rim is rough-turned at the same time
by a cutter held in the extension turret tool-holder <i>T</i> (<a href="#Fig_5_5">Fig. 5</a>),
and the taper fit on the inside of the flywheel is turned by means
of cutter <i>A</i> (<a href="#Fig_5_4">Fig. 4</a>) held in a tool-holder attached to the turret.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 5. Elevation of Turret and Tools for Finishing Flywheels&mdash;First Operation</p>
</div>

<p>The outside of the wheel rim is next finish-turned with cutter
<i>V</i> (<a href="#Fig_5_5">Fig. 5</a>) held in an extension turret tool-holder the same as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_185" id="Pg_185">[185]</a></span>
the roughing tool <i>T</i>. At the same time, the bore is finished
by a cutter in boring-bar <i>D</i> (<a href="#Fig_5_4">Fig. 4</a>). The side of the rim and
the hub of the wheel are also finished at this time by two facing
cutters <i>H</i> and <i>K</i>, held in tool-holders on the face of the turret.
When the finishing cuts on the rim and hub are being taken,
the work is supported by a bushing on the boring-bar which enters
the bore of the wheel, the boring cutter and facing tools being
set in such relation to each other that the final boring of the hole
is completed before the facing cuts are taken.</p>

<p>The web of the wheel is next finish-faced with the facing cutter
held in the holder <i>E</i>, and the taper surface on the inside of the
rim is finished by the tool <i>L</i>, at the same time. While these
last operations are performed, the work is supported by a bushing
on a supporting arbor <i>J</i>, which enters the bore of the wheel.
The bore is finally reamed to size by a reamer <i>F</i> held in a &#8220;floating&#8221;
reamer-holder. When the reaming operation is completed,
a clearance groove <i>N</i> is cut on the inside of the rim, using a
tool <i>G</i> held in the carriage toolpost. The first cycle of operations
on the flywheel is now completed.</p>

<a name="Fig_5_6" id="Fig_5_6"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><div class="illobox450"><img src="images/194sm.png" alt="Second Cycle of Operations on Flywheel" /></div>
<p class="caption750">Fig. 6. Second Cycle of Operations on Flywheel</p>
</div>

<p>The flywheel is then removed from the chuck, turned around,
and held in &#8220;soft&#8221; jaws for the second cycle of operations, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_186" id="Pg_186">[186]</a></span>
jaws fitting the outside of the wheel rim. (Soft unhardened
jaws are used to prevent marring the finished surface of the
rim.) The operations on this side are very similar to those performed
on the other side. First, the side of the rim, the inside
of the rim, the web, and hub are rough-turned, using tools held
in the carriage toolpost. The inside of the rim and the web are
then finished by a cutter held in a tool-holder at <i>P</i>, <a href="#Fig_5_6">Fig. 6</a>, which
is bolted to the face of the turret. The work is supported
during this operation by a bushing held on a supporting arbor
<i>U</i>, having a pilot which enters a bushing in the chuck. Finally,
the rim and hub are finished, by the facing cutters <i>R</i> and <i>S</i>,
the work being supported by an arbor, as before.</p>

<p>These operations illustrate the methods employed in automobile
factories, and other shops where large numbers of engine
flywheels, etc., must be machined.</p>

<a name="Secnum_5_4" id="Secnum_5_4"></a><p><b>Finishing a Flywheel at One Setting in Turret Lathe.</b>&mdash;The
plan view <i>A</i>, <a href="#Fig_5_7">Fig. 7</a>, shows an arrangement of tools for finishing
a flywheel complete at one setting. The hole for the shaft has
to be bored and reamed and the hub faced on both sides. The
sides and periphery of the rim also have to be finished and all
four corners of the rim rounded. The tools for doing this work
consist of boring-bars, a reamer, facing heads on the main turret,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_187" id="Pg_187">[187]</a></span>
a turret toolpost on the slide rest (carrying, in this case, three
tools) and a special supplementary wing rest attached to the
front of the carriage at the extreme left.</p>

<p>The casting is held by three special hardened jaws <i>b</i> in a universal
chuck. These jaws grip the work on the inner side of the
rim, leaving room for a tool to finish the rear face without striking
the chuck body or jaws. Three rests <i>c</i> are provided between
the chuck jaws. The work is pressed against these rests while
being tightened in the chuck, and they serve to locate it so that
the arms will run true so far as sidewise movement is concerned.
These rests also locate the casting with relation to the stops for
the turret and carriage movements. The chuck carries a bushing
<i>r</i> of suitable diameter to support the boring-bars in the main
turret, as will be described.</p>

<p>In the first operation, boring-bar <i>m</i> is brought in line with the
spindle and is entered in bushing <i>r</i> in the chuck. Double-ended
cutter <i>n</i> is then fed through the hub of the pulley to true up the
cored hole. While boring the hole, the scale on the front face
of the rim and hub is removed by tool <i>j</i>. Tool <i>k</i> is then brought
into action to rough turn the periphery, after which tool <i>e</i>, in
the wing rest, is fed down to clean up the back face of the rim.
As soon as the scale is removed, the hole is bored nearly to size
by cutter <i>n<sub>1</sub></i> in bar <i>m<sub>1</sub></i>, and it is finally finished with reamer <i>q</i>
mounted on a floating arbor.</p>

<p>The cutters <i>f</i>, <i>g</i> and <i>h</i>, in the facing head, are next brought up
to rough face the hub and rim, and round the corners of the rim
on the front side. This operation is all done by broad shaving
cuts. The facing head in which the tools are held is provided
with a pilot bar <i>t</i> which fits the finished hole in the flywheel hub,
and steadies the head during the operation. The cutters <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>
and <i>h</i> are mounted in holders which may be so adjusted as to
bring them to the proper setting for the desired dimensions.
This completes the roughing operations.</p>

<p>The periphery of the rim is now finished by cutter <i>l</i> in the
turret toolpost which is indexed to the proper position for this
operation. The rear face of the rim is finished by the same
tool <i>e</i> with which the roughing was done. Tool <i>e</i> is then removed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_189" id="Pg_189">[189]</a></span>
and replaced with <i>d</i> which rounds the inner corner of the
rim. Tool <i>d</i> is also replaced with a third tool for rounding the
outer corner of the rear side. For finishing the front faces of
the rim and hub and rounding the corners of the rim, a second
facing head, identical with the first one, is employed. This is
shown in position in the illustration. Cutters <i>f<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>g<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>h<sub>1</sub></i> correspond
with the cutters <i>f</i>, <i>g</i> and <i>h</i>, previously referred to, and
perform the same operations.</p>

<p>The remaining operation of finishing the back of the hub is
effected by cutter <i>p</i>. This cutter is removed from the bar, which
is then inserted through the bore; the cutter is then replaced in
its slot and the rear end of the hub is faced by feeding the carriage
away from the headstock. This completes the operations, the
flywheel being finished at one setting.</p>

<a name="Secnum_5_5" id="Secnum_5_5"></a><p><b>Finishing a Webbed Flywheel in Two Settings.</b>&mdash;The plan
views <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, <a href="#Fig_5_7">Fig. 7</a>, show the arrangement of tools for finishing
a webbed flywheel which has to be machined all over. This,
of course, requires two operations. In the first of these (see
sketch <i>B</i>) the rough casting is chucked on the inside of the rim
with regular inside hard chuck jaws <i>b</i>. The cored hole is first
rough bored with cutter <i>n</i> attached to the end of boring-bar <i>m</i>,
and guided by the drill support <i>d</i> pivoted to the carriage. Next,
the boring-bar <i>m<sub>1</sub></i> is brought into position, the drill support
being swung back out of the way. This bar is steadied by its
bearing in bushing <i>r</i> in the chuck. Two cutters, <i>n<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>n<sub>2</sub></i>, are
used to roughly shape the hole to the desired taper, the small
end being finished to within 0.002 inch of the required diameter.
While boring with the bar <i>m<sub>1</sub></i>, the scale is broken on the web
and hub of the casting by the tool <i>k</i> in the turret toolpost. The
latter is then shifted to bring the tool <i>j</i> into position for removing
the scale on the periphery of the wheel. Next, the hole is
reamed with taper reamer <i>q</i>, the pilot of which is supported by
bushing <i>r</i>.</p>

<p>The first of the facing heads is now brought into action. This
facing head carries a guide <i>t</i> which is steadied in a taper bushing
<i>c</i>, driven into the taper hole of the hub for that purpose. The
top cutter <i>f</i> turns the periphery, cutter <i>g</i> turns the hub and faces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_190" id="Pg_190">[190]</a></span>
the web, and cutter <i>h</i> faces the rim. A fourth cutter <i>e</i> on the
under side of the head faces the hub. This casting is now
machined approximately to size.</p>

<p>For finishing, similar cutters, <i>e<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>f<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>g<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>h<sub>1</sub></i>, in the other
facing head are used, the latter being supported by the taper
bushing <i>c</i> in the same way. A very light cut is taken for finishing.
Tool <i>l</i> in the carriage turret is used to round the outer and
inner corners of the rim, which completes the work on this face
of the casting.</p>

<p>In the second cycle of operations, shown at <i>C</i>, the casting is
chucked on the outside with the soft jaws <i>b</i>, which are bored to
the exact diameter of the finished rim. The work is further
supported and centered by sliding bushing <i>c</i>, which is tapered
to fit the finished hole in the hub, and has an accurate bearing
in bushing <i>r</i> in the chuck. This bushing is provided with a
threaded collar for forcing it into the work and withdrawing it.
The scale on the web and the inside and face of the rim is first
broken with the tool <i>k</i> in the turret toolpost. These surfaces
are then roughed off with cutters <i>f</i>, <i>g</i> and <i>h</i>, in the facing head.
This latter is steadied by a pilot <i>t</i> which enters the hole in the
sliding bushing <i>c</i> on which the work is supported. A light cut
is next taken with cutters <i>f<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>g<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>h<sub>1</sub></i>, in the finishing facing
head, which completes the operation.</p>

<a name="Secnum_5_6" id="Secnum_5_6"></a><p><b>Tools for Turret Lathes.</b>&mdash;The operation of a turret lathe after
the tools have been properly arranged is not particularly difficult,
but designing and making the tools, determining what
order of operations will give the most efficient and accurate
results, and setting the tools on the machine, requires both skill
and experience. For some classes of work, especially if of a
rather complicated nature, many of the tools must be specially
designed, although there are certain standard types used on
turret lathes which are adapted to general turning operations.
Some of the principal types are referred to in the following.</p>

<a name="Fig_5_8" id="Fig_5_8"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><div class="illobox450"><img src="images/199sm.png" alt="Different Types of Box-tools for Turret Lathe" /></div>
<p class="caption750">Fig. 8. Different Types of Box-tools for Turret Lathe</p>
</div>

<a name="Secnum_5_7" id="Secnum_5_7"></a><p><b>Box-tools.</b>&mdash;Tools of this type are used for turning bar
stock. There are many different designs, some of which are
shown in <a href="#Fig_5_8">Figs. 8</a>, <a href="#Fig_5_9">9</a> and <a href="#Fig_5_10">10</a>. Box-tools are held in the turret and
they have back-rests opposite the turning tools, for supporting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_191" id="Pg_191">[191]</a></span>
the part being turned. The box-tool shown at <i>A</i>, <a href="#Fig_5_8">Fig. 8</a>, is for
roughing. The cutter <i>a</i> is a piece of high-speed steel beveled
on the cutting end to produce a keen edge. It takes a shearing
tangent cut on top of the bar and the latter is kept from springing
away by means of the adjustable, hardened tool-steel back-rest
<i>b</i>. This tool is considered superior to a hollow mill whenever
a fair amount of stock must be removed. If considerable
smoothness and accuracy are necessary, the finishing box-tool
shown at <i>B</i> should follow the roughing box tool, but in most
cases, especially if the part is to be threaded by a die, a finishing
cut is unnecessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_192" id="Pg_192">[192]</a></span>
The finishing box-tool <i>B</i> is also used to follow a hollow mill if
special accuracy or smoothness is desired. This tool is only
intended for light finishing cuts, the allowances varying from
0.005 inch to 0.015 inch in diameter. The cutters are made of
square tool steel of commercial size, and are ground and set to
take a scraping end cut. This particular tool has two tool-holders
which permit finishing two diameters at once. If a
larger number of sizes must be turned, extra tool-holders can
be applied.</p>

<p>The single-cutter box-tool shown at <i>C</i> is bolted directly to the
face of the turret instead of being held by a shank in the turret
hole, and it is adapted for heavy cuts such as are necessary
when turning comparatively large bar stock. The tool-holder <i>a</i>
swivels on a stud, thus allowing the cutter to be withdrawn
from the work while being returned, which prevents marring the
turned surface. The high-speed steel cutter is ground to take
a side cut on the end of the bar. The latter is supported by
hardened and ground tool-steel rolls <i>b</i> which revolve on hardened
and ground studs. These rolls are mounted on swinging arms
which have a screw adjustment for different diameters. They
can also be adjusted parallel to the bar, thus enabling them to
be set either in advance of or back of the cutter. The opening
in the base allows the stock to pass into the turret when it is not
larger than the turret hole.</p>

<p>The box-tool shown at <i>D</i> is similar to the one just described,
except that it has two or more cutters and roller back-rests, thus
enabling different diameters to be turned simultaneously. The
cutters are ground to take a side cut. Ordinarily this gives a
satisfactory finish, but if special accuracy and smoothness are
desired, two tools should be used, one for roughing and one for
finishing, the latter being ground to take a light scraping end cut.</p>

<p>The taper-turning box-tool shown at <i>E</i> is designed for accurately
turning tapers on brass or cast-iron parts, when there is a
small amount of stock to be removed. The taper is obtained by
cross motion imparted to the cutter slide as the turret advances.
The taper-turning box-tool shown at <i>F</i>, instead of having a
single-point cutter, is provided with a wide cutter <i>a</i>. This tool
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_193" id="Pg_193">[193]</a></span>
is designed to turn tapering parts of small or medium diameter,
requiring the use of a support which cannot be provided with a
straight forming tool and holder mounted on the cut-off slide.
The cutter is backed up by the screws shown, which also provide
adjustment for different tapers within a limited range.
The bar is supported by the three back-rests shown, which also
have screw adjustment.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 9. Box-tools and Work for which they are Intended</p>
</div>

<a name="Secnum_5_8" id="Secnum_5_8"></a><p><b>Examples of Box-tool Turning.</b>&mdash;Box-tools are not only used
for cylindrical and taper turning on the end of a bar, but for
many other operations. <a href="#Fig_5_9">Figs. 9</a> and <a href="#Fig_5_10">10</a> show a number of box-tools
of different designs, with examples of the work for which
each is intended. While these tools are designed for some
specific part, they can, of course, with slight modifications be
adapted to other work.</p>

<p>A box-tool of the pilot type that is used for finishing, after
the surplus stock has been removed by roughing tools, is shown
at <i>A</i>, <a href="#Fig_5_9">Fig. 9</a>. The work, which is the cone for a ball bearing, is
shown at <i>a</i> by the dotted lines and also by the detail view to the
right. The pilot <i>b</i> enters the work before either of the cutters
begins to operate on its respective surface. The inverted cutter
<i>c</i>, which sizes the flange of the cone, is held in position by a clamp
<i>d</i>, which is forced down by a collar-head screw. The cutter is
further secured against a beveled shoulder at <i>g</i> by the set-screws <i>f</i>,
and it is adjusted forward by the screw <i>e</i>. By loosening the
screws <i>f</i> and the collar-head screw, the cutter may be removed
for sharpening. The cutter <i>h</i> is adjusted to cut to the proper
diameter, by the screws <i>l</i>, after which the clamp <i>k</i> is made level
by the screw <i>j</i>. The collar-screw <i>m</i> is then used to secure the
tool in place. The cutter is made from drill rod and it is slightly
cupped out on the cutting end to give keenness to the cutting
edge. The adjusting screw <i>o</i>, which passes through plate <i>p</i>, prevents
the cutter from backing away from the work. This adjusting
screw plate has its screw holes slotted to avoid removing the
screws when it becomes necessary to remove the plate and
cutter for sharpening. Pilot <i>b</i> is held firmly to the tool body
by set-screw <i>r</i>. The hole <i>s</i> through the shank makes it easy to
remove the pilot, in case this is necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_195" id="Pg_195">[195]</a></span>
A pilot box-tool for finishing another type of ball bearing cone
is shown at <i>B</i>. The shape of the work itself is indicated by the
dotted lines <i>a</i> and by the detail view. This tool is somewhat
similar in its construction to the one just described. The cutters
<i>b</i> and <i>c</i> are inverted and are used to face the flange at <i>d</i> and to
turn it to the proper diameter. These cutters are held by the
clamp <i>f</i> and screws <i>g</i> and are adjusted forward by the screw <i>h</i>.
The cutter <i>j</i>, which operates on top of the stock, rests on a
bolster, of the proper angle and is adjusted up or down by the
screws <i>k</i>. The clamp <i>l</i>, which binds against this tool, is beveled
to correspond with the angle of the tool. This clamp is secured
by the collar-screw shown and it is leveled by set-screws <i>s</i>. The
adjusting screw <i>p</i> prevents the cutter from slipping back. The
holes in the adjusting-screw plate are also slotted in this case so
that it will not be necessary to remove any screws when the
cutter has to be taken out of the holder.</p>

<p>A box-tool for finishing a treadle-rod cone for a sewing machine
is shown at <i>C</i>. This tool is also of the pilot type. The
cutters in it operate on opposite sides of the cone <i>a</i>. The inverted
cutter <i>b</i> sizes the cylindrical part of the cone, while the
front cutter <i>d</i> is set at the proper angle to finish the tapered
part. The rear cutter <i>b</i> is held in place by the clamp <i>g</i> and a
collar screw. It is adjusted forward by the screw <i>h</i> in the plate
<i>i</i> which is held by screws as shown. The pilot is retained by a
set-screw, and it is easily removed by inserting a small rod in
the hole <i>l</i> which passes through the shank. The cutter <i>d</i> is held
by clamp <i>m</i> and is adjusted by screw <i>n</i> which passes through a
tapped hole in plate <i>o</i>. The screw holes in both the adjusting
plates <i>i</i> and <i>o</i> are slotted to facilitate their removal.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 10. Examples of Box-tool Designs</p>
</div>

<p>The box-tool illustrated at <i>A</i>, <a href="#Fig_5_10">Fig. 10</a>, is used for finishing
the bushing of a double-taper cone bearing <i>a</i>. The cutters are
so arranged that they all cut on the center; that is, the cutting
edges lie in a horizontal plane. The inverted cutter <i>b</i> at the
rear forms the short angular surface, and the cutter <i>c</i> in front
forms the long tapering part of the bearing. The large diameter
is turned, to size by cutter <i>d</i>. The pilot <i>e</i> has a bearing in the
bore nearly equal to the length of the work and it is provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_196" id="Pg_196">[196]</a></span>
with oil grooves, as shown. The taper shank of this pilot is
tapped for the screw <i>i</i> which extends the whole length of the
shank and is used to draw the pilot back to its seat. It is not
necessary to remove adjusting-screw plate <i>k</i> to take out the cutter
<i>b</i>, as the latter can be drawn out from the front after the collar-screw
<i>m</i> is loosened. The cutter <i>c</i> is removed by taking off the
adjusting-screw plate <i>s</i> after loosening the collar-screw <i>n</i>. The
cutter <i>d</i> is held in a dove-tailed slot by two headless set-screws <i>q</i>.
It is also backed up by an adjusting screw in the plate <i>s</i>. These
adjusting screws should all have fine threads, say from 32 to
40 per inch, and be nicely fitted so they will not loosen after being
adjusted.</p>

<p>The box-tools shown at <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, <a href="#Fig_5_10">Fig. 10</a>, are for turning the
sides of a loose pulley for a sewing machine. This pulley (shown
by the dotted lines) is finished in two operations. The box-tool
for finishing the side of the pulley on which the hub projects
beyond the rim, is shown at <i>B</i>. The inverted cutter <i>a</i>,
which faces the end of the hub, is held by a clamp <i>c</i> (clearly
shown in the end view) from the under side and it has no adjustment.
The collar-screw <i>d</i> is tapped into this clamp, which
is prevented from getting out of place by the dowel-pin <i>f</i>. The
pilot <i>g</i> is made small in the shank, so that tool <i>a</i> can be so placed
as to insure the removal of all burrs around the bore of the
hub. The pilot is held by a set-screw and it is provided with oil
grooves. The cutter <i>j</i> sizes the outside of the hub, and the cutter
<i>k</i> faces the side of the pulley rim. These cutters are both held
by the clamp <i>l</i> and the collar-screw <i>m</i>. No side plates are used
on this tool, and the cutters are all easily removed.</p>

<p>Sketch <i>C</i> shows the box-tool used for the second operation.
As the hub is flush with the rim on the side for which this tool
is intended, it needs only one cutter to face both. This is done
by the wide cutter <i>a</i> which is held in a dove-tailed slot in the
front of the tool and is fastened by the clamp <i>b</i> and collar-screw
<i>c</i>. The bushing <i>d</i>, in which the end of the work arbor is supported,
is held by the collar-screw <i>e</i>, and to obtain the necessary
compression, the body of the tool is slotted as far back as <i>f</i>. This
bushing is provided with oil grooves and one side is cut away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_198" id="Pg_198">[198]</a></span>
to clear the cutter <i>a</i>. The pilot end of the arbor on which the
work is mounted is <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">16</sub> inch smaller than the bore of the pulley,
which allows the cutter to be set in far enough to prevent any
burr which might form at the edge of the bore. A disk <i>i</i> is inserted
back of bushing <i>d</i>, so that the latter may be easily removed
by passing a rod through the hollow shank. The special chuck
used for this second operation on the loose pulley is screwed
onto the spindle, and the work is mounted on a projecting arbor
and driven by the pins engaging holes in the pulley web. The
arbor is made a driving fit for the work, and the end or pilot is
a running fit in the bushing of the box-tool. A counterbore
in the arbor hub provides clearance for the hub of the pulley
which projects beyond the rim on one side.</p>

<a name="Secnum_5_9" id="Secnum_5_9"></a><p><b>Hollow Mills.</b>&mdash;A hollow mill such as is shown at
<i>A</i> in <a href="#Fig_5_11">Fig. 11</a>
is sometimes used in place of a box-tool (especially when turning
brass) for short roughing cuts preceding a threading operation.
The turning is done by the cutting edges <i>e</i>, and the turned part
enters the mill and is steadied by it. If this type of tool is used
for long, straight cuts, especially on square stock and when
making screws with large heads from the bar, it should always
be followed by a finishing box-tool to insure accurate work. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_199" id="Pg_199">[199]</a></span>
hollow mill can be sharpened readily by grinding the ends without
materially changing the cutting size. A slight adjustment
can be obtained by means of the clamp collar shown to the
left, although this is not generally used. When making these
mills, they should be reamed out tapering from the rear to give
clearance to the cutting edges. For turning steel, the cutting
edge should be about <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">10</sub> of the diameter ahead of the center,
whereas for brass, it should be on the center-line.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 12. Geometric Adjustable Hollow Milling Tool</p>
</div>

<p>Hollow mills are also made adjustable. The design shown in
<a href="#Fig_5_12">Fig. 12</a> is especially adapted for brass finishing. It can also be
used for taking light cuts on cast iron or steel but its use in
place of roughing or finishing box-tools for general use is not
recommended. With the exception of the cutters and screws,
the complete tool consists of three parts, <i>viz.</i>, the holder, cam,
and ring. The cam serves to adjust the cutters for different
diameters. The adjustment is made by the two screws shown,
the amount being indicated by a micrometer scale. When adjusting
the cutters for a given diameter, the use of a hardened
steel plug of the required size is advisable, the cutters being
adjusted against the plug.</p>

<a name="Secnum_5_10" id="Secnum_5_10"></a><p><b>Releasing Die and Tap Holders.</b>&mdash;Threads are cut in the
turret lathe by means of dies for external threading, and taps for
internal threading, the die or tap being held in a holder attached
to the turret. A simple form of releasing die holder is shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_200" id="Pg_200">[200]</a></span>
at <i>B</i>, <a href="#Fig_5_11">Fig. 11</a>. This holder was designed for the spring-screw
type of threading die shown to the left. The die is clamped in
the holder <i>a</i> by the set-screw shown, and the shank <i>b</i> of the holder
is inserted in the turret hole. Holder <i>a</i> has an extension <i>c</i> which
passes through the hollow shank. When the die is pressed
against the end of the work, holder <i>a</i> and its extension moves
back until lug <i>d</i> on the holder engages lug <i>e</i> on the shank. The
die and holder are then prevented from rotating with the work
and the die begins to cut a thread. It continues to screw itself
onto the work with the turret following, until the thread has
been cut to the required length; the turret is then stopped and
as the die and holder <i>a</i> are drawn forward, lugs <i>d</i> and <i>e</i> disengage
so that the die simply rotates with the work without continuing
to advance. The lathe spindle is then reversed and as the turret
is moved back by hand, pin <i>f</i> comes around and enters notch <i>g</i>,
thus holding the die stationary; the die then backs off from the
threaded end. Some tap holders are also constructed the same
as this die holder, so far as the releasing mechanism is concerned.
There are also many other designs in use, some of which
operate on this same principle.</p>

<a name="Secnum_5_11" id="Secnum_5_11"></a><p><b>Self-opening Die Heads.</b>&mdash;The type of die holder shown at
<i>B</i> in <a href="#Fig_5_11">Fig. 11</a> is objectionable because of the time required for
backing the die off the threaded end; hence, self-opening dies
are extensively used in turret lathe work. As the name implies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_201" id="Pg_201">[201]</a></span>
this type of die, instead of being solid, has several chasers
which are opened automatically when the thread has been cut
to the required length. The turret can then be returned without
reversing the lathe spindle. The dies are opened by simply
stopping the travel of the turret slide, the stop-rod for the feed
of the turret being adjusted to give the proper amount of travel.</p>

<a name="Fig_5_13" id="Fig_5_13"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><div class="illobox450"><img src="images/208sm.png" alt="Self-opening and Adjustable Screw-cutting Die Head" /></div>
<p class="caption750">Fig. 13. Geometric Self-opening and Adjustable Screw-cutting Die Head</p>
</div>

<p>A well-known die head of the self-opening type is shown in
<a href="#Fig_5_13">Fig. 13</a>. The dies open automatically as soon as the travel of
the head is retarded, or they can be opened at any point by simply
holding back on the turnstile or lever by which the turret slide
is moved. The die is closed again by means of the small handle
seen projecting at right-angles from the side of the head. The
closing may be done by hand or automatically by screwing a pin
into a threaded hole opposite the handle and attaching a small
piece of flat steel to the back edge of the turret slide. The latter
will then engage the pin as the turret revolves, thus closing
the die head. This die head has a roughing and finishing attachment
which is operated by handle <i>A</i>. When this handle
is moved forward, the dies are adjusted outward 0.01 inch for
the roughing cut, whereas returning the handle closes and locks
the dies for the finishing cut. The die head has a micrometer
scale which is used when making slight adjustments to compensate
for the wear of the chasers or to make either a tight-or
a loose-fitting thread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_202" id="Pg_202">[202]</a></span>
<a name="Secnum_5_12" id="Secnum_5_12"></a><b>Collapsing Taps.</b>&mdash;The collapsing tap shown in <a href="#Fig_5_14">Fig. 14</a> is one
of many different designs that are manufactured. They are
often used in turret lathe practice in place of solid taps. When
using this particular style of collapsing tap, the adjustable gage
<i>A</i> is set for the length of thread required. When the tap has
been fed to this depth, the gage comes into contact with the
end of the work, which causes the chasers to collapse automatically.
The tool is then withdrawn, after which the chasers
are again expanded and locked in position by the handle seen at
the side of the holder. In all threading operations, whether
using taps or dies, a suitable lubricant should be used, as a better
thread is obtained and there is less wear on the tools. Lard oil
is a good lubricant, although cheaper compounds give satisfactory
results on many classes of work.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 15. Various Types of Tools for the Turret Lathe</p>
</div>

<a name="Secnum_5_13" id="Secnum_5_13"></a><p><b>Miscellaneous Turret Lathe Tools.</b>&mdash;The chamfering tool
shown at <i>A</i>, <a href="#Fig_5_15">Fig. 15</a>, is used for pointing the end of a bar before
running on a roughing box-tool. This not only finishes the
end of the bar but provides an even surface for the box-tool to
start on. The cutter is beveled on the end to form a cutting
edge and it is held at an angle. The back-rest consists of a
bell-mouthed, hardened tool-steel bushing which supports the
bar while the cut is being taken.</p>

<p>The stop gages <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> are used in the turret to govern the
length of stock that is fed through the spindle. When a finished
piece has been cut off, the rough bar is fed through the spindle
and up against the stop gage, thus locating it for another operation.
This gage may be a plain cylindrical piece of hardened
steel, as at <i>B</i>, or it may have an adjusting screw as at <i>C</i>; for
special work, different forms or shapes are also required. The
stop gages on some machines, instead of being held in the turret,
are attached to a swinging arm or bracket that is fastened to
the turret slide and is swung up in line with the spindle when
the stock is fed forward.</p>

<p>The center drilling tool <i>D</i> is designed to hold a standard combination
center drill and reamer. This type of tool is often used
when turning parts that must be finished afterwards by grinding,
to form a center for the grinding machine. The adjustable turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_203" id="Pg_203">[203]</a></span>
tool <i>E</i> is used for turning the outside of gear blanks, pulley
hubs or the rims of small pulleys. The pilot <i>a</i> enters the finished
bore to steady the tool, and cutter <i>b</i> is adjusted to turn to the
required diameter.</p>

<p>The cutting-off tool-holder <i>F</i> (which is held on the cross-slide
of the turret lathe) is usually more convenient than a regular
toolpost, as the blade can be set closer to the chuck. The
blade is held in an inclined position, as shown, to provide rake
for the cutting edge; the inclined blade can also be adjusted
vertically, a limited amount, by moving it in or out. The
multiple cutting-off tool <i>G</i> holds two or more blades and is used
for cutting off several washers, collars, etc., simultaneously.
By changing the distance pieces between the cutters, the latter
are spaced for work of different widths. The flat drill holder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_204" id="Pg_204">[204]</a></span>
<i>H</i> is used for drilling short holes, and also to form a true &#8220;spot&#8221;
or starting point for other drills.</p>

<p>Knurling tools are shown at <i>I</i> and <i>J</i>. The former is intended
for knurling short lengths and is sometimes clamped on
top of the cut-off tool on the cross-slide, the end being swung
back after knurling (as shown by the dotted lines) to prevent
interference with the work when the cutting-off tool is in operation.
The knurling tool <i>J</i> has a shank and is held in the turret.
The two knurls are on opposite sides of the work so that the
pressure of knurling is equalized. By adjusting the arms which
hold the knurls, the tool can be set for different diameters.</p>

<p>Three styles of drill holders are shown at <i>K</i>, <i>L</i> and <i>M</i>. Holder
<i>K</i> is provided with a split collet (seen to the left) which is tightened
on the drill shank by a set-screw in the holder. This
holder requires a separate collet for each size drill. The taper
shank drill holder <i>L</i> has a standard taper hole into which the
shank of the drill is inserted. The adjustable type of holder <i>M</i> is
extensively used, especially on small and medium sized machines
when several sizes of drills are necessary. This holder is simply
a drill chuck fitted with a special shank. For large drills the
plain style of holder <i>K</i> is recommended, and if only a few sizes
of drills are required, it is more satisfactory and economical
than the adjustable type.</p>

<p>The various types of small turret lathe tools referred to in
the foregoing for turning, threading, tapping, knurling, etc., are
a few of the many different designs of tools used in turret lathe
practice. Naturally, the tool equipment for each particular
job must be changed somewhat to suit the conditions governing
each case. The tools referred to, however, represent in a general
way, the principal types used in ordinary practice. Some
of the more special tools are shown in connection with examples
of turret lathe work, which are referred to in the following.</p>

<a name="Secnum_5_14" id="Secnum_5_14"></a><p><b>Turning Gasoline Engine Pistons in Turret Lathe.</b>&mdash;The
making of pistons for gas engines, especially in automobile factories,
is done on such a large scale that rapid methods of machining
them are necessary. The plan view <i>A</i>, <a href="#Fig_5_16">Fig. 16</a>, shows
the turret lathe tools used in one shop for doing this work. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_205" id="Pg_205">[205]</a></span>
is often advisable with work done in large quantities, the rough
castings are made with extra projections so arranged as to assist
in holding them. These projections are, of course, removed
when the piece is completed. In this case the piston casting <i>a</i>
has a ring about 1<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">4</sub> inch long and a little less in diameter than
the piston, at the chucking end. The piston is held in suitable
chuck jaws <i>b</i> which are tightened against the inside of this ring.
The set-screws in these special jaws are then tightened, thus
clamping the casting between the points of the screws and the
jaws. This method of holding permits the whole exterior of
the piston to be turned, since it projects beyond the chuck jaws.
This is the object in providing the piston with the projecting
ring by which it is held.</p>

<p>The first operation consists in rough-boring the front end of
the piston. The double-ended cutter <i>n</i> is held in boring-bar <i>m</i>,
which is, in turn, supported by a drill-holder, clamped to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_206" id="Pg_206">[206]</a></span>
of the faces of the turret. This bar is steadied by a bushing in
the drill support <i>c</i> which is attached to the carriage, and may be
swung into or out of the operating position, as required. After
this cut is completed, the turret is revolved half way around and
the casting is finish-bored in a similar manner, with double-ended
cutter <i>n<sub>1</sub></i> held in bar <i>m<sub>1</sub></i>, the drill support being used as in
the previous case. The support is then turned back out of the
way to allow the turning tools in the turret toolpost to be used.</p>

<p>The outside of the piston is next rough-turned with tool <i>k</i>
in the turret toolpost, which is revolved to bring this cutter into
action. The toolpost is then turned to the position shown,
and the outside is finish-turned by tool <i>j</i>, which takes a broad
shaving cut. The turret tool-holder is again revolved to bring
form tool <i>l</i> into position. This tool cuts the grooves for the
piston rings. Suitable positive stops are, of course, provided
for both the longitudinal and cross movements of the turret
toolpost.</p>

<p>In the second operation, the piston <i>a</i> is reversed and held in
soft jaws, which are used in place of the hardened jaws <i>b</i> shown in
the illustration. These jaws are bored to the outside diameter
of the piston, so that when closed, they hold the work true or
concentric with the lathe spindle. In this operation the chucking
ring by which the piston was previously held is cut off, and
the end of the piston is faced true. If the crank-pin hole is to
be finished, a third operation is necessary, a self-centering chuck-plate
and boring and reaming tools being used. (These are not
shown in the illustration.)</p>

<a name="Secnum_5_15" id="Secnum_5_15"></a><p><b>Turning Piston Rings in Turret Lathe.</b>&mdash;One method of turning
piston rings is shown at <i>B</i> in <a href="#Fig_5_16">Fig. 16</a>. The piston rings are
cut from a cast-iron cylindrical piece which has three lugs <i>b</i>
cast on one end and so arranged that they may be held in a three-jawed
chuck. This cylindrical casting is about 10 inches long,
and when the rings are to have their inside and outside surfaces
concentric, the casting is held by the lugs in the regular jaws
furnished with the chuck. (The arrangement used for turning
and boring eccentric rings, which is that shown in the illustration,
will be described later.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_207" id="Pg_207">[207]</a></span>
The casting <i>a</i>, from which the rings are made, is first rough-bored
with double-ended cutter <i>n</i> in boring-bar <i>m</i>, after which
it is finish-bored with cutter <i>n<sub>1</sub></i> in bar <i>m<sub>1</sub></i>. While taking these
cuts, the bars <i>m</i> and <i>m<sub>1</sub></i> are supported by their extension ends
which enter bushing <i>r</i> located in the central hole of the chuck.
This furnishes a rigid support so that a heavy cut can be
taken.</p>

<p>The outside of the casting is next rough-turned with tool <i>k</i>,
held in the turret toolpost. This toolpost is then revolved to
bring tool <i>j</i> into position, by which the outside is turned true to
size, a broad shaving chip being taken. The toolpost is again
swung around, to bring the cutting-off tool-holder <i>l</i> into position.
This holder contains four blades set the proper distance apart
to give rings of the desired width. Each blade, from right to
left, is set a little back of the preceding one, so that the rings are
cut off one after the other, the outer rings being supported until
they are completely severed. After the first four rings are cut
off, the carriage is moved ahead to a second stop, and four more
rings are severed, this operation being continued until the casting
has been entirely cut up into rings.</p>

<p>When the bore of the ring is to be eccentric with the outside,
the holding arrangement shown in the illustration is used. The
casting a is bolted to a sliding chuck-plate <i>c</i>, and the outside is
rough-turned with tool <i>k</i> in the toolpost. Finishing tool <i>j</i> is
then brought into action, and the outside diameter is turned
accurately to size. Then the sliding chuck-plate <i>c</i>, carrying the
work, is moved over a distance equal to the eccentricity desired,
and the work is bored with cutters <i>n</i> and <i>n<sub>1</sub></i> as in the previous
case. The turret toolpost is next revolved and the tools <i>l</i> are
used for cutting off the rings. The reason for finishing the
outside first is to secure smooth rings in cutting off, as this
operation should be done when the work is running concentric
with the bore, rather than with the exterior surface.</p>

<p>It will be evident that this method gives a far greater output
of rings than is possible by finishing them in the more primitive
way on engine lathes. The faces of the rings may be finished in
a second operation if desired, or they may be ground, depending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_208" id="Pg_208">[208]</a></span>
on the method used in the shop where the work is being done,
and the accuracy required.</p>

<a name="Secnum_5_16" id="Secnum_5_16"></a><p><b>Piston Turning in Pratt and Whitney Turret Lathe.</b>&mdash;A turret
lathe equipped with tools for turning, facing and grooving automobile
gasoline engine pistons is shown in <a href="#Fig_5_17">Fig. 17</a>. The piston
is held on an expanding pin chuck which is so constructed that
all of the pins are forced outward with equal pressure and automatically
conform to any irregularities on the inside of the
piston. Tool <i>A</i> rough-turns the outside, and just as this tool
completes its cut, a center hole is drilled and reamed in the end
of the piston by combination drill and reamer <i>B</i>. The turret
is then indexed one-half a revolution and a finishing cut is taken
by tool <i>C</i>. After the cylindrical body of the piston has been
turned, tools held in a special holder <i>E</i> attached to the cut-off
slide are used to face the ends of the piston and cut the packing-ring
grooves. While the grooves are being cut, the outer
end of the piston is supported by center <i>D</i>. The center hole in
the end also serves to support the piston while being ground to
the required diameter in a cylindrical grinding machine. The
edge at the open end of the piston may also be faced square and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_209" id="Pg_209">[209]</a></span>
the inner corner beveled by a hook tool mounted on the rear
cross-slide, although this is usually done in a separate operation.
(This provides a true surface by which to hold this end when
grinding.)</p>

<p>This illustration (<a href="#Fig_5_17">Fig. 17</a>) shows very clearly the stops which
automatically disengage the turret feed. A bracket <i>F</i> is bolted
to the front of the bed and contains six stop-rods <i>G</i> (one for each
position or side of the turret). When one of these stop-rods
strikes lever <i>H</i>, the feed is disengaged, the stop being adjusted
to throw out the feed when the tool has completed its cut.
Lever <i>H</i> is automatically aligned with the stop-rods for different
sides of the turret by a cam <i>J</i> on the turret base. A roller
<i>K</i> bears against this cam and, through the connecting shaft and
lever shown, causes lever <i>H</i> to move opposite the stop-rod for
whatever turret face is in the working position. Lever <i>L</i> is
used for engaging the feed and lever <i>R</i> for disengaging it by
hand.</p>

<p>The indexing of the turret at the end of the backward movement
of the slide is controlled by stop <i>M</i> against which rod <i>N</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_210" id="Pg_210">[210]</a></span>
strikes, thus disengaging the lock bolt so that the turret can turn.
This stop <i>M</i> is adjusted along the bed to a position depending
upon the length of the turret tools and the distance the turret
must move back to allow the tools to clear as they swing around.</p>

<a name="Secnum_5_17" id="Secnum_5_17"></a><p><b>Attachment for Turning Piston Rings.</b>&mdash;<a href="#Fig_5_18">Fig.
18</a> shows a special attachment applied to a Pratt &amp; Whitney turret lathe for
turning eccentric, gas-engine piston rings. The boring of the
ring casting, turning the outside and cutting off the rings, is
done simultaneously. The interior of the casting is turned concentric
with the lathe spindle by a heavy boring-bar, the end of
which is rigidly supported by a bushing in the spindle. The
slide which carries the outside turning tool is mounted on a
heavy casting which straddles the turret. The outside of the
ring casting is turned eccentric to the bore as a result of an in-and-out
movement imparted to the tool by a cam on shaft <i>A</i>
which is rotated from the lathe spindle through the gearing
shown. For each revolution of the work, the tool recedes from
the center and advances toward it an amount sufficient to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_211" id="Pg_211">[211]</a></span>
the required eccentricity. When the turning and boring tools
have fed forward about 2 inches, then the cutting-off tools which
are held in holder <i>B</i> come into action. The end of each cutting-off
tool, from right to left, is set a little farther away from the
work than the preceding tool, so that the end rings are always
severed first as the tools are fed in by the cross-slide. A number
of the completed rings may be seen in the pan of the machine.</p>

</div>

<p>An interesting example of flat turret lathe work is shown in
<a href="#Fig_5_22">Fig. 22</a>. This is a steel shell which must be accurately finished
to a slight taper, both inside and out, threaded and plain recesses
are required at the ends, and, in addition, one or two minor
operations are necessary. This work is done in the Hartness
flat turret lathe, built by the Jones &amp; Lamson Machine Co.
The shells are turned from cold-drawn seamless steel tubing,
having a carbon content of 0.20 per cent, and they are finished
at the rate of one in nine minutes. The tubing comes to the
machine in 12-foot lengths, and the tube being operated upon
is, of course, fed forward through the hollow spindle as each
successive shell is severed.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 23. First Operation on Shell Illustrated in <a href="#Fig_5_22">Fig. 22</a>&mdash;Rough-turning and Boring</p>
</div>

<p>In finishing this shell, five different operations are required.
During the first operation the shell is rough-bored and turned by
one passage of a box-tool, <a href="#Fig_5_23">Fig. 23</a>, and the recess <i>A</i>, <a href="#Fig_5_22">Fig. 22</a>,
at the outer end, is finished to size by a second cutter located in
the boring-bar close to the turret. The turret is then indexed
to the second station which brings the threading attachment <i>G</i>
into position, as shown in <a href="#Fig_5_24">Fig. 24</a>. After the thread is finished,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_215" id="Pg_215">[215]</a></span>
the recess <i>B</i>, <a href="#Fig_5_22">Fig. 22</a>, is turned by a flat cutter <i>K</i>, <a href="#Fig_5_25">Fig. 25</a>. The
inner and outer surfaces are then finished to size by a box-tool
mounted on the fourth station of the turret and shown in position
in <a href="#Fig_5_26">Fig. 26</a>. The final operation, <a href="#Fig_5_27">Fig. 27</a>, is performed by three
tools held on an auxiliary turret cross-slide, and consists in
rounding the corners at <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, <a href="#Fig_5_22">Fig. 22</a>, and severing the finished
shell.</p>

<p>One of the interesting features connected with the machining
of this shell is the finishing of the inner and outer tapering surfaces.
The taper on the outside is <sup class="enum">3</sup>/<sub class="denom">32</sub> inch per foot, while the
bore has a taper of only <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">64</sub> inch per foot, and these surfaces are
finished simultaneously. The box-tool employed is of a standard
type, with the exception of an inserted boring-bar, and the
taper on the outside is obtained by the regular attachment which
consists of a templet <i>D</i> (<a href="#Fig_5_23">Fig. 23</a>) of the required taper, that
causes the turning tool to recede at a uniform rate as it feeds along.
To secure the internal taper, the headstock of the machine is
swiveled slightly on its transverse ways by the use of tapering
gibs. By this simple method, the double taper is finished to
the required accuracy without special tools or equipment.</p>

</div>

<p>As those familiar with this machine know, the longitudinal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_216" id="Pg_216">[216]</a></span>
movements of the turret as well as the transverse movements
of the headstock are controlled by positive stops. The headstock
of this machine has ten stops which are mounted in a revolving
holder and are brought into position, as required, by
manipulating a lever at the front. The stops for length, or those
controlling the turret travel, are divided into two general groups,
known as &#8220;A&#8221; and &#8220;B&#8221;. Each of these groups has six stops
so that there are two stops for each of the six positions or stations
of the turret, and, in addition, five extra stops are available for
any one tool, by the engagement of a pin at the rear of the turret.
The change from the &#8220;A&#8221; to the &#8220;B&#8221; stops is made by adjusting
lever <i>L</i>, <a href="#Fig_5_26">Fig. 26</a>, which also has a neutral position.</p>

<p>After the box-tool for the roughing cut, shown at work in
<a href="#Fig_5_23">Fig. 23</a>, has reached the end of its travel, further movement is
arrested by a stop of the &#8220;A&#8221; group. The outside turning tool
is then withdrawn by operating lever <i>E</i> and the turret is run
back and indexed to the second station, thus bringing the threading
attachment into position. The surface speed of 130 feet per
minute which is used for turning is reduced to about 30 feet per
minute for threading by manipulating levers <i>H</i>, <a href="#Fig_5_24">Fig. 24</a>. After
the turret is located by another stop of the &#8220;A&#8221; group,
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_217" id="Pg_217">[217]</a></span>
threading attachment is made operative by depressing a small
plunger <i>I</i>, which connects a vertical driving shaft from the
spindle with the splined transmission shaft <i>J</i>. A reciprocating
movement is then imparted to the thread chaser <i>t</i> which advances
on the cutting stroke and then automatically retreats to clear
the thread on the return. This movement is repeated until
the thread is cut to the proper depth, as determined by one
of the stops for the headstock. While the thread is being cut,
the carriage is locked to the bed by the lever <i>N</i>, <a href="#Fig_5_26">Fig. 26</a>. It was
found necessary to perform the threading operation before taking
the outside finishing cut, owing to a slight distortion of the
shell wall, caused by the threading operation.</p>

<p>After the thread is finished, the turret is turned to the third
station as shown in <a href="#Fig_5_25">Fig. 25</a>, and tool <i>K</i> for the inner recess <i>B</i>,
<a href="#Fig_5_22">Fig. 22</a>, is brought into position and fed to the proper depth,
as determined by another cross-stop. The turret is also locked
in position for this operation. The finishing cuts for the bore
and the outside are next taken by a box-tool which is shown
near the end of its cut in <a href="#Fig_5_26">Fig. 26</a>. This box-tool is similar to
the one used for roughing, but it is equipped with differently
shaped cutters to obtain the required finish. The outside turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_218" id="Pg_218">[218]</a></span>
tool has a straight cutting edge set tangent to the cylindrical
surface and at an angle, while the boring tool has a cutting
edge of large radius. An end view of this box-tool is shown in
<a href="#Fig_5_27">Fig. 27</a>. A reduced feed is employed for the finishing cut, and
the speed is increased to 130 feet per minute, which is the same
as that used for roughing.</p>

<p>During the next and final operation, the turret, after being
indexed to the position shown in <a href="#Fig_5_27">Fig. 27</a>, is first located by a
stop of the &#8220;A&#8221; group so that the cutting-off tool <i>R</i> in front can
be used for rounding the corner <i>b</i>, <a href="#Fig_5_22">Fig. 22</a>. The stop lever <i>L</i>
is then shifted and the turret is moved to a second stop of the
&#8220;B&#8221; group. The corner <i>c</i> is then rounded and the shell is
scored at <i>d</i> by two inverted tools <i>S</i> and <i>T</i> at the rear, after which
the finished work is severed by the cut-off tool at the front.
The cross-movement of these three tools is controlled by positive
stops on the cross-slide, and the latter is moved to and fro by
hand lever <i>O</i>. After the shell is cut off, the stop <i>M</i>, mounted
on the turret, <a href="#Fig_5_26">Fig. 26</a>, is swung into position, and the tube is
automatically fed forward to the swinging stop by the roll feed,
as soon as the chuck is released by operating lever <i>Q</i>. This
completes the cycle of operations. A copious supply of lubricant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_219" id="Pg_219">[219]</a></span>
is, of course, furnished to the tools during these operations,
and the two boring-tool shanks are hollow so that lubricant
can be forced through them and be made to play directly upon
the cutters.</p>

a cylindrical part <i>A</i> which is held in a three-jaw universal chuck.
The front flange is first rough-turned by a bent turning tool <i>B</i>.
The diameter is regulated by one of the cross-stops at <i>D</i> which
has been previously set and controls the movement of the turret

has been turned, by an independent stop. This machine has twelve
longitudinal stops, there being one for each turret face and six
auxiliary stops, in addition to the stops for the cross-slide.</p>

<p>After roughing the flange, the turret carriage is locked or
clamped rigidly to the bed to prevent any lengthwise movement,

in to the diameter of the hub which is indicated by a micrometer
dial on the cross-feed screw. The carriage is then unlocked
and auxiliary stop No. 7 is engaged (by turning a knob at the
front of the slide) and the cylindrical hub is turned back to the
rear flange, the feed being disengaged by the auxiliary stop just
as the tool reaches the flange. The cross-slide is now moved
outward, longitudinal auxiliary stop No. 8 is engaged, the
turret slide is moved against the stop, the carriage is locked and
the front sides of both the front and rear flanges are rough-faced
by tools <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>. The turret is next indexed and the hole
rough-bored by cutter <i>E</i>. After again indexing the turret, the
hub and flanges are finish-turned and faced by tools <i>F</i> and <i>G</i>,
as described for the rough-turning operation. The final operation
is that of finishing the bore by cutter <i>H</i>.</p>

</div>

<a name="Secnum_5_22" id="Secnum_5_22"></a><p><b>Double-spindle Flat Turret Lathe.</b>&mdash;The extent to which
modern turning machines have been developed, especially for
turning duplicate parts in quantity, is illustrated by the design
of turret lathe the turret and head of which is shown in <a href="#Fig_5_30">Fig. 30</a>.
This machine has two spindles and a large flat turret which holds
a double set of tools, so that two duplicate castings or forgings
can be turned at the same time. It was designed primarily for
chuck work and can be used as a single-spindle machine if desirable.
When two spindles are employed for machining two duplicate
parts simultaneously, considerably more time is required for
setting up the machine than is necessary for the regular single-spindle
type, but it is claimed that the increased rate of production
obtained with the two-spindle design more than offsets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_222" id="Pg_222">[222]</a></span>
this initial handicap. The manufacturers consider the single-spindle
machine the best type for ordinary machine building
operations, regardless of whether the work is turned from the
bar or is of the chucking variety. On the other hand, the double-spindle
type is preferred when work is to be produced in such
quantities that the time for setting up the machine becomes a
secondary consideration.</p>

<p>When the double-spindle machine is used as a single-spindle
type, a chuck 17 inches in diameter is used, and when both
spindles are in operation, two 9-inch chucks are employed.
The general outline of the turret is square, and the tools are
rigidly held, with a minimum amount of overhang, by means
of tool-blocks and binding screws connected with the clamping
plates. Two duplicate sets of tools are clamped to each side of
the turret and these operate simultaneously on the two pieces
held in the chucks or on faceplates. Primarily the turret is used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_223" id="Pg_223">[223]</a></span>
in but four positions, but when a 17-inch chuck or faceplate is
employed, corner blocks may be held by the clamping plates in
which tools are supported, giving, if necessary, four additional
operations by indexing the turret to eight positions.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 31. Diagram showing Tool Equipment and Successive Steps<br />in
Machining Sprocket Blanks on Double-spindle Flat Turret Lathe</p>
</div>

<p>A typical job to demonstrate the application of the double-spindle
flat turret lathe is illustrated in <a href="#Fig_5_31">Fig. 31</a>. The parts to
be turned are sprocket wheels which are held in the two 9-inch
chucks. At the first position of the turret (which is the one
illustrated), the inside is rough-bored by tools <i>A</i>. At the second
position of the turret, tools <i>B</i> rough-face the inner sides of the
flanges; tools <i>C</i> face the outer sides of the flanges, while tools <i>D</i>
turn the faces of the flanges. At the third position of the turret,
tools <i>E</i> finish-turn the inside of the flanges; tools <i>F</i> finish-turn
the outside of the flanges, while tools <i>G</i> finish the faces of the
flanges. At the fourth position of the turret, tools <i>H</i> finish-bore
the sprockets; tools <i>I</i> complete the turning on the outside of the
flanges, while tools <i>J</i> accurately size the interior of the flanges.</p>

<p>With the double-spindle flat turret lathe, each operation is a
double operation, and the speeds are varied according to the
nature of the cut; thus, if at one position of the turret, the tools
are required to rough out the work, this may be done rapidly,
for it has no bearing on the other operations that are subsequently
performed. Furthermore, if the following operation
has to be performed with great care, this may be done without
reducing the speed of the less exacting operations.</p>

and turning machine shown in <a href="#Fig_5_32">Fig. 32</a> is automatic in its operation,
the feeding of the tools, indexing of the turret, etc., being
done automatically after the machine is properly arranged, and
the work is placed in the chuck. This machine is adapted to
turning and boring a great variety of castings, forgings or parts
from bar stock, and it is often used in preference to the hand-operated
turret lathe, especially when a great many duplicate
parts are required. It is provided with mechanism for
operating the cross-slide, feeding the turret slide forward, returning
it rapidly, rotating the turret to a new position, and
feeding it forward quickly for taking a new cut. The cross-slide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_225" id="Pg_225">[225]</a></span>
and turret-slide movements are effected by cams mounted on
the large drum <i>E</i> seen beneath the turret, while the various
speed and feed changes are effected by dogs and pins carried on
disk <i>D</i> which is keyed to the same shaft that the cam drum is
mounted upon. This shaft with the cam drum and governing
disk <i>D</i>, makes one revolution for each piece of work completed.
The cams for operating the turret slide are mounted upon the
periphery of drum <i>E</i>. The roll which engages the angular faces
of these cams and imparts movement to the turret is carried
by an intermediate slide which has rack teeth engaging a pinion
on the square shaft <i>C</i>. By turning this shaft with a crank, the
position of the turret-slide, with relation to the cam, may be
adjusted for long or short work and long or short tools, as may
be required.</p>

<p>The cams which operate the cross-slide are mounted on the
right-hand end of drum <i>E</i> and actuate the yoke <i>A</i> (see <a href="#Fig_5_33">Fig. 33</a>)
which extends diagonally upward. The rear end of this yoke
has rack teeth meshing with the teeth of a segmental pinion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_226" id="Pg_226">[226]</a></span>
which is fastened to rock-shaft <i>B</i>. At the headstock end, this
rock-shaft carries another segmental pinion meshing with rack
teeth formed on the cross-slide. The movement imparted to
the yoke by the cams is thus transmitted through the pinions
and rock-shaft to the cross-slide.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 34. The Automatic Controlling Mechanism for Feeds and Speeds</p>
</div>

<p>The cam drum <i>E</i> is driven by a pinion meshing with a gear
attached to its front side. This pinion is driven through a train
of gearing from pulley <i>L</i> (see <a href="#Fig_5_34">Fig. 34</a>) which is belted to the
spindle. The feeds are thus always dependent on the spindle
speed. By means of epicyclic gearing and suitable clutches,
the motion thus derived from the spindle may be made rapid
for returning the turret to be indexed and then advancing it to
the cutting position again, or very slow for the forward feed when
the tools are at work. These changes from slow to fast or <i>vice
versa</i> are controlled by disk <i>D</i>. This disk carries pins which
strike a star wheel located back of the disk at the top, and as
this star wheel is turned, the speeds are changed by operation
of the gearing and clutches referred to. The first pin <i>M</i> that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_227" id="Pg_227">[227]</a></span>
strikes the star wheel advances it one-sixth of a rotation, changing
the feed from fast to slow; the next pin that strikes it advances
it another sixth of a rotation, changing the feed from slow to
fast and so on. By adjusting the pins for each piece of work,
the feed changes are made to take place at the proper time.
Handwheel <i>E</i> is geared with the cam-shaft on which the star
wheel is mounted, so that the feeds may be changed by hand
if desired.</p>

<p>In addition to these feed-changing pins, disk <i>D</i> has a dog
which operates a lever by which the feed movement is stopped
when the work has been completed. Four rates of feed are
provided by quick change gearing of the sliding gear type, operated
by handle <i>K</i>. With this handle set in the central position,
the feed is disengaged. On the periphery of disk <i>D</i> are also
clamped dogs or cams <i>N</i>, which operate a horizontal swinging
lever <i>P</i> connected by a link with vertical lever <i>J</i>, which controls
the two spindle speeds with which the machine is provided.
Either one of these speeds can be automatically engaged
at any time, by adjusting the cams <i>N</i> on disk <i>D</i>.</p>

<p>Lever <i>H</i> connects or disconnects the driving pulley from the
shaft on which it is mounted, thus starting or stopping the
machine. The square shaft <i>G</i> serves to operate the drums by
hand and is turned with a crank. The rotation of the turret,
which takes place at the rear of its travel, is, of course, effected
automatically. A dog, which may be seen in <a href="#Fig_5_32">Fig. 32</a> at the side
of the bed, is set to trip the turret revolving mechanism at the
proper point in the travel, to avoid interference between the
tools and the work. The turret is provided with an automatic
clamping device. The mechanism first withdraws the locking
pin, unclamps the turret, revolves it, then throws in the locking
pin and clamps the turret again.</p>

<a href="#Fig_5_35">Fig. 35</a>. This is a second operation, and a very simple one
which will clearly illustrate the principles involved. In the first
operation, the hole was drilled, bored and reamed, the small end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_228" id="Pg_228">[228]</a></span>
of the bushing faced, and the outside diameter finished, as indicated
by the sketch to the left. (The enlarged diameter at the
end was used for holding the work in the chuck.) In the second
operation (illustrated to the right), the enlarged chucking end
is cut off and, in order to prevent wasting this piece, it is made
into a collar for another part of the machine for which the bushing
is intended; hence, the outside diameter is turned and the
outside end faced, before cutting off the collar. In addition,
the bushing is recessed in the second operation, and the outer
end faced. In order to have the surfaces finished in the second
operation, concentric with those machined in the first operation,
the chuck is equipped with a set of soft &#8220;false jaws&#8221; which have
been carefully bored to exactly the diameter of the work to be
held.</p>

<p>The first thing to determine when setting up a machine of
this type is the order of operations. In this particular case,
the order is as follows: At the first position of the turret, the
outside collar is rough-turned and the outer end rough-faced.
At the second position, the collar is turned to the required diameter
and the outer face is finished. The third face of the turret
is not equipped with tools, this part of the cycle being taken up
in cutting off the collar with a cut-off tool on the rear cross-slide.
The fourth operation is that of recessing the bushing, and the
fifth operation, facing the end to remove the rough surface left
by the cutting-off tool.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 36. Front View of Machine set up for the Finishing Operation on the
Recessed Bushing and Collar shown in the Foreground and in <a href="#Fig_5_35">Fig. 35</a></p>
</div>

<p>The tools <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, <a href="#Fig_5_36">Fig. 36</a>, used for turning the outside of
the flange, are held in brackets <i>C</i> bolted to the face of the turret.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_229" id="Pg_229">[229]</a></span>
These brackets are each provided with three holes for carrying
turning tool-holders. This arrangement provides for turning a
number of diameters at different positions, simultaneously, but
for this particular operation, a single cutting tool for each tool-holder
is all that is necessary. A special device is used for recessing
and will be described later.</p>

<a name="Fig_5_37" id="Fig_5_37"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/238sm.png" alt="Plate on the Headstock of Machine Illustrated in Fig. 32" />
<p class="caption750">Fig. 37. Plate on the Headstock of Machine Illustrated in<br /><a href="#Fig_5_32">Fig. 32</a>
giving the Speeds and Feeds</p>
</div>

<a name="Secnum_5_25" id="Secnum_5_25"></a><p><b>Determining Speed and Feed Changes.</b>&mdash;As previously mentioned,
the particular machine illustrated in <a href="#Fig_5_32">Fig. 32</a> can be
arranged for two automatic changes of speed to suit different
diameters on the work. The change gears that will give the
required spindle speeds should first be selected. These change
gears for different speeds are listed on a speed and feed plate
attached to the headstock of the machine (see <a href="#Fig_5_37">Fig. 37</a>). It is
possible to use one speed from the list given for the fast train
of gears, and one from the list for the slow train, so long as the
same gears are not used in each case. The diameter of the
collar on the work shown in <a href="#Fig_5_35">Fig. 35</a> is 2<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class=
"denom">2</sub> inches, and the diameter
of the body is 2 inches. Assuming that the surface speed
for this job should be about 40 feet per minute, a little calculation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_230" id="Pg_230">[230]</a></span>
shows that the 66 revolutions per minute, given by the fast
train of gears, is equivalent to a surface speed of 43 feet per
minute on a diameter of 2<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub> inches. Moreover, the 78 revolutions
per minute obtained from the slow train of gearing, gives
about 41 feet per minute on a diameter of 2 inches. The spindle
gearing indicated for these speeds is, therefore, placed in position
on the proper studs at the back of the machine.</p>

<p>Next we have to determine on which faces of the turret to
place the different tools. Each turret face is numbered to
agree with the corresponding feed cam on the drum. The speed
and feed plate (<a href="#Fig_5_37">Fig. 37</a>) gives the various feeds obtainable per
revolution of the spindle. As will be seen, the different cams
give different feeds. Cam No. 1 has a coarse feed suitable for
roughing; cam No. 2 a finer feed adapted to finishing, and so on.
Since the first operation consists in rough-turning, cam No. 1
is used. Cam No. 2, which gives a finer feed, is used for the
finish-turning operation. Cam No. 4, which is ordinarily used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_231" id="Pg_231">[231]</a></span>
for reaming, could, in this case, be used for recessing, as this
recess is for clearance only and may be bored with a coarse feed.</p>

<p>The final operation, which is that of facing, can be done with
any cam and cam No. 5 may be used. It will be understood
that for facing operations, the feeds given do not apply. As
the roll passes over the point of the feed cam at the extreme
end of the movement, the feed of the turret slide is gradually
slowed down to zero; since the facing takes place in the last
eighth or sixteenth inch of this movement, it is done at a feed
which is gradually reduced to zero. This is, of course, as it
should be, and it is not necessary to pay any attention to the
tabulated feeds in facing operations.</p>

<a name="Secnum_5_26" id="Secnum_5_26"></a><p><b>Setting the Turret Slide.</b>&mdash;The next adjustment is that of
setting the turret slide. In making this adjustment the turret
is set in such relation to the work that the tools will have but
a small amount of overhang, the cam-shaft being revolved by
hand until the cam-roll is at the extreme top of the forward
feeding cam, so that the turret slide is at the extreme of its forward
movement. When this adjustment has been made by the
means provided, set the turret index tripping dog so as to revolve
the turret at the proper point. After a turning tool-holder and
tool is attached to the face of the turret, cam No. 1 is placed
in its operating position and is revolved by hand until the roll
is on the point of the cam and the turret at the forward extreme
of its motion. At this point the tool-holder is set so that the
cutter will be far enough forward to complete its turning operation.
The feed cam is then turned backward, thus returning
the turret slide, and the cutter is set to turn the flange to the
proper diameter for the roughing cut. The turret slide is fed
forward and back while the cutter is adjusted, and when it is
properly set, the flange is turned, the cam-drum being fed by
hand. This is the first trial cut on the piece.</p>

<p>A facing tool, shown in the working position in <a href="#Fig_5_36">Fig. 36</a>, is placed
at this station of the turret, being held in the turret hole. This
tool has a pilot bar and a holder which contains a facing blade.
Feeding by hand, as before, the tool is adjusted lengthwise so
as to rough-face the work to the dimension desired. In a similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_232" id="Pg_232">[232]</a></span>
way the finish-turning and facing tools for the second position
of the turret are set, the cam-shaft being revolved by hand to
bring this second face and second cam into the working position.
(The finish-facing tool is not shown in place in <a href="#Fig_5_36">Fig. 36</a>.)</p>

<a name="Secnum_5_27" id="Secnum_5_27"></a><p><b>Setting the Cross-slide Cam.</b>&mdash;As previously mentioned, the
third turret face has no tool, the cutting off of the collar being
done during this part of the cycle of operations. It has been
taken for granted that in setting the turret slide, room has been
left between it and the chuck for the cross-slide. The cross-slide
is clamped in a longitudinal position on the bed, convenient
for the cutting-off operation, which is done with a tool <i>D</i> (<a href="#Fig_5_36">Fig. 36</a>)
in the rear toolpost, thus leaving the front unobstructed for the
operator. When both forming and cutting off are to be done,
the forming tool is generally held at the front and the cutting-off
tool at the back because heavier and more accurate forming
can be done with the work revolving downward toward a tool
in the front toolpost, than with the tool at the rear where it is
subjected to a lifting action.</p>

<a name="Fig_5_38" id="Fig_5_38"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><div class="illobox450"><img src="images/240sm.png" alt="Diagram of Cross-slide Cams and Feeding Mechanism" /></div>
<p class="caption750">Fig. 38. Diagram of Cross-slide Cams and Feeding Mechanism</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_233" id="Pg_233">[233]</a></span>
The arrangement of the cross-slide cams is shown in <a href="#Fig_5_38">Fig. 38</a>,
which is an end view of the large drum <i>E</i>, <a href="#Fig_5_32">Fig. 32</a>. The rear
feed cam is the one to be used, and since this cutting-off operation
is a short one, it may be done during the return of the turret for
position No. 3. The cam drum is, therefore, rotated by hand
until the turret face No. 3 has begun to return. The cross-slide
cams are then loosened and the rear feed cam is swung around
to just touch the roller <i>R</i> which operates arm <i>A</i>, the cross-slide
having been adjusted out to nearly the limit of its forward
travel, leaving approximately enough movement for cutting off
the collar. The rear feed cam is then clamped in this position.</p>

<p>A cutting-off tool is next placed in the rear toolpost at the
proper height. The rear toolpost slide is then adjusted to bring
the point of the cutting-off tool up to the work, and the cam
drum is revolved by hand until the piece is cut off. The cross-slide
tool is, of course, set in the proper position to make a collar
of the required thickness. Feeding by hand is discontinued
when the roll is on the point of the cam; the cutting-off tool
slide is then permanently set on the cross-slide so that the point
of the cutting-off tool enters the bore just far enough to completely
sever the collar from the bushing. The motion of the
cam drum is continued, by hand, until the roll is over the point
of the feed cam. The cross-slide is then pushed back, by hand,
until the cam and roll are again in contact, when the return
cam is brought up and clamped in position, so that there is just
room for the roll between the feed cam and the return cam.
The rear return cam (as the hand feed of the cam drum is continued)
brings the cross-slide back to its central position. Since
there is no front tool used for this series of operations (although
a tool is shown in the front toolpost, <a href="#Fig_5_36">Fig. 36</a>), the first feed and
return cams are allowed to remain wherever they happen to be.
These cam adjustments can all be made from the front of the
machine.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 39. Flexible Boring Tool used for Recessing<br />a Bushing in Automatic
Chucking and Turning Machine</p>
</div>

<a name="Secnum_5_28" id="Secnum_5_28"></a><p><b>Setting the Boring Tool for Recessing.</b>&mdash;The feeding of the
turret slide is now continued to make sure that the cutting-off
tool is returned to its normal position before the facing tool in
the next face of the turret begins to work. The facing of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_234" id="Pg_234">[234]</a></span>
bushing, so far as the setting of the tool is concerned, is merely
a repetition of the facing operation at the first position of the
turret. The recessing tool is next set. This tool, which is
shown diagrammatically in <a href="#Fig_5_39">Fig. 39</a>, is very simple as compared
with the somewhat complex operation it has to perform. This
recess is for clearance only, and accurate dimensions and fine
finish are not necessary. The recessing tool consists simply of a
slender boring-bar held in the turret and carrying a cutter suitably
located about midway the bar. The forward end of the bar
is small enough to enter a bell-mouthed bushing held in the
chuck. The boring-bar is bent to one side far enough so that
the cutter clears the hole as the bar enters, but is forced into
the work as the rounded hole of the bushing engages the end of
the bar and deflects it into the working position. The upper
diagram shows the position of the bar as it enters the hole, and
the lower one the position after it has entered the bushing and
is engaged in turning the recess. This bar is set in the turret
so that at the extreme forward travel of the turret slide, the
recess will be bored to the required length. The cutter must
also be adjusted to bore to the desired diameter. This completes
the setting of the cutting tools.</p>

<a name="Secnum_5_29" id="Secnum_5_29"></a><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_235" id="Pg_235">[235]</a></span>
<b>Adjustments for Automatic Feed and Speed Changes.</b>&mdash;The
machine must now be set to perform automatically the desired
changes of spindle speed and the fast and slow cam movements
for the tools. After placing a new piece of work in the machine
(the first one having been completed in the setting-up operation),
the cam-shaft is revolved by hand until the turning tool in turret
face No. 1 is just about to begin its cut. The control wheel <i>D</i>,
<a href="#Fig_5_34">Fig. 34</a>, is rotated in its normal direction until the next graduation
marked &#8220;slow&#8221; is in line with an index mark on the base of the
machine. Then the nearest pin <i>M</i> is moved up until it bears
against a tooth of the star wheel (previously referred to) and is
clamped in this position. The pin should now be in the proper
location, but to test its position, rotate the cam shaft backward
by hand and throw in the automatic feed; then watch the cut
to see if the drum slows down just before the tool begins to work.
If it does not, the pin should be adjusted a little, one way or the
other, as may be required. (In going over a piece of work for
the first time, it is best to have the feed set to the smallest rate,
feed change handle <i>K</i> being in position No. 1.)</p>

<p>After the cut has been completed and the turret feed cam-roll
is on the high part of the cam, the power feed should again be
stopped and the handwheel revolved until the next graduation
marked &#8220;fast&#8221; is opposite the index mark. The next stop pin
is then moved up until it just touches the star wheel, where it
is clamped in position. The feed being again thrown in, the
turret will be returned rapidly, indexed, and moved forward for
the second operation. After stopping the automatic movement,
the pins are set for this face, and so on for all the operations,
including that in which the cross-slide is used for cutting off
the finished collar.</p>

<p>As the first, second, and third operations are on comparatively
large diameters, they should be done at the slow speed, handle <i>J</i>,
<a href="#Fig_5_34">Fig. 34</a>, being set to give that speed. While the turret slide is
being returned between operations 3 and 4, one of the spindle
speed-changing dogs <i>N</i> should be clamped to the rim of disk <i>D</i>
so as to change the spindle speed to the fast movement. This
speed is continued until the last operation is completed, when a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_236" id="Pg_236">[236]</a></span>
second dog is clamped in place to again throw in the slow movement.
The feed knock-off dog should also be clamped in place
on the disk to stop the machine at the completion of the fifth
operation, when the turret is in its rear position. This completes
the setting up of the machine. If the feed is finer than is necessary,
the feed change handle <i>K</i> may now be moved to a position
which will give the maximum feed that can be used.</p>

<p>It has taken considerable time to describe the setting up of
the machine for this simple operation, but in the hands of a
competent man it can be done quite rapidly. While a simple
operation has been referred to in the foregoing, it will be understood
that a great variety of work can be done on a machine of
this type. It is not unusual to see as many as ten cutting tools
operating simultaneously on a piece of work, the tools being
carried by the turret, cross-slide and back facing attachment.
The latter is operated from a separate cam applied to the cam-shaft
and acting through levers on a back facing bar which passes
through a hole in the spindle. In this back facing bar may
be mounted drills, cutters, facing tools, etc. for machining the
rear face of a casting held in the chuck jaws. Where extreme
accuracy is required, a double back facing attachment may be
used, arranged with cutters for taking both roughing and finishing
cuts. The use of this attachment often saves a second operation.
This automatic chucking and turning machine is also adapted
for bar work, especially in diameters varying from 3 to 6 inches.</p>

and Turning Machine</p>
</div>

<a name="Secnum_5_30" id="Secnum_5_30"></a><p><b>Turning Flywheel in Automatic Chucking and Turning Machine.</b>&mdash;A
typical operation on the Potter &amp; Johnston automatic
chucking and turning machine is illustrated in <a href="#Fig_5_40">Fig. 40</a>,
which shows the machine arranged for turning the cast-iron flywheel
for the engine of a motor truck. The rim is turned and
faced on both sides and the hub is bored, reamed and faced on
both sides. The flywheel casting is held in a chuck by three
special jaws which grip the inside of the rim. The order of the
operations is as follows:</p>

<p>The rear end of the hub is faced by the back facing bar; the
cored hole is started by a four-lipped drill in the turret and
the front end of the hub is rough-faced. (These tools are on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_237" id="Pg_237">[237]</a></span>
rear side of the turret when the latter is in the position shown
in the illustration.) After the turret indexes, the hole is rough-bored
by tool <i>A</i> and while this is being done, the outside of the
rim is rough-turned by tool <i>B</i> held in a special bracket attached
to the turret. Both sides of the rim are also rough-faced by
tools <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> held at the front of the cross-slide, this operation
taking place at the same time that the rim is turned and the
hole is being bored.</p>

<p>The turret again automatically recedes and indexes, thus locating
bar <i>E</i> and turning tool <i>G</i> in the working position. The
hole is then finish-bored by tool <i>E</i> and the hub is finish-faced by
blade <i>F</i>; at the same time the rim is finish-turned by tool <i>G</i> and
the sides are finish-faced to the proper width by two tools held
at the rear of the cross-slide. The turret automatically recedes
and indexes a third time, thus locating the flat-cutter reamer-bar
<i>H</i> in the working position and then the hole is reamed to the
required diameter. This completes the cycle of operations.
The total time for machining this flywheel is forty minutes.</p>

<b>Automatic Multiple-spindle Chucking Machine.</b>&mdash;An example
of the specialized machines now used for producing
duplicate parts, is shown in <a href="#Fig_5_41">Fig. 41</a>. This is a &#8220;New Britain&#8221;
automatic multiple-spindle chucking machine of the single-head
type and it is especially adapted for boring, reaming and facing
operations on castings or forgings which can readily be held in
chuck jaws. This particular machine has five spindles, which
carry and revolve the tools. The work being machined is held
stationary in the multiple chuck turret <i>A</i> which holds each part
in line with one of the spindles and automatically indexes, so that
the work passes from one spindle to another until it is finished.
The turret then indexes the finished piece to a sixth or &#8220;loading
position&#8221; which is not opposite a spindle, where the part is removed
and replaced with a rough casting. Each pair of chuck
jaws is operated independently of the others by the use of a chuck
wrench. These jaws are made to suit the shape of the work.</p>

<p>When a single-head machine is in operation, the turret advances
and feeds the work against the revolving tools so that a number
of pieces are operated upon at the same time. The turret is fed
by a cam drum <i>B</i>. Cam strips are bolted to the outside of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_239" id="Pg_239">[239]</a></span>
drum and act directly against a roller attached to the yoke <i>C</i>
which can be clamped in different positions on the spindle <i>D</i>,
the position depending upon the length of the work. On the
opposite end of the turret spindle is the indexing mechanism <i>E</i>.
An automatically spring-operated latch <i>F</i> engages notches in
the rim of the dividing wheel, thus accurately locating the turret.
The turret is locked by a steadyrest <i>G</i>, which, for each working
position, automatically slides into engagement with one of the
notches in the turret. This relieves the indexing mechanism of
all strain.</p>

<p>This type of machine is also built with two spindle heads,
the double-head design being used for work requiring operations
on both ends. When the double-head machine is in operation,
the revolving spindles and tools advance on both sides of the
chuck turret, the latter remaining stationary except when
indexing. The feed drums on the double-head machine are
located directly beneath each group of spindles.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 42. Detail View of New Britain Double-head Eight-spindle<br />Machine,
Boring, Reaming and Facing Castings</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#Fig_5_42">Fig. 42</a> shows an example of work on a machine of the double-head
design. This is an eight-spindle machine, there being two
groups of four spindles on each side of the turret. The castings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_240" id="Pg_240">[240]</a></span>
<i>E</i> are for the wheel hubs of automobiles. The order of the operations
on one of the castings, as it indexes around, is as follows:
The hole in the hub is first rough-reamed by taper reamer <i>A</i>
and the opposite end of the hub is rough-faced and counterbored
by a tool in spindle <i>A<sub>1</sub></i>. When the turret indexes, this same
casting is reamed close to the finished size by reamer <i>B</i> and the
left end of the hub is rough-faced by cutter <i>F</i>, while a tool in the
opposite spindle <i>B<sub>1</sub></i> finishes the counterboring and facing operation.
At the third position, reamer <i>C</i> finishes the hole accurately
to size, and when the work is indexed to the fourth position,
the hub on the left side is finish-faced by a tool in spindle <i>D</i>.
(The third and fourth spindles of the right-hand group are not
used for this particular operation.) When the turret again
indexes, the finished casting is removed and replaced with a
rough one. While the successive operations on a single casting
have just been described, it will be understood that all of the
tools operate simultaneously and that a finished casting arrives
at the unloading and loading position each time the turret indexes.
Three hundred of these malleable castings are machined
in nine hours.</p>

<a name="Secnum_5_32" id="Secnum_5_32"></a><p><b>Selecting Type of Turning Machine.</b>&mdash;The variety of machine
tools now in use is very extensive, and as different types can
often be employed for the same kind of work, the selection of
the best and most efficient machine is often a rather difficult
problem. To illustrate, there are many different types and
designs of turning machines, such as the ordinary engine lathe,
the hand-operated turret lathe, the semi-automatic turning
machine, and the fully automatic type, which, after it is &#8220;set
up&#8221; and started, is entirely independent. Hence, when a certain
part must be turned, the question is, what kind of machine
should be used, assuming that it would be possible to employ
several different machines? The answer to this question usually
depends principally upon the number of parts that must be
turned.</p>

<p>For example, a certain casting or forging might be turned in
a lathe, which could be finished in some form of automatic or
semi-automatic turning machine much more quickly. It does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_241" id="Pg_241">[241]</a></span>
not necessarily follow, however, that the automatic is the best
machine to use, because the lathe is designed for general work
and the part referred to could doubtless be turned with the
regular lathe equipment, whereas the automatic machine would
require special tools and it would also need to be carefully adjusted.
Therefore, if only a few parts were needed, the lathe
might be the best tool to use, but if a large number were required,
the automatic or semi-automatic machine would doubtless
be preferable, because the saving in time effected by the latter
type would more than offset the extra expense for tool equipment
and setting the machine. It is also necessary, in connection
with some work, to consider the degree of accuracy required,
as well as the rate of production, and it is because of these varying
conditions that work of the same general class is often done
in machines of different types, in order to secure the most efficient
results.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapnum_6" id="Chapnum_6">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>
<h3>VERTICAL BORING MILL PRACTICE</h3>
<hr class="c05" />

<p>All the different types of turning machines now in use originated
from the lathe. Many of these tools, however, do not
resemble the lathe because, in the process of evolution, there
have been many changes made in order to develop turning
machines for handling certain classes of work to the best advantage.
The machine illustrated in <a href="#Fig_6_1">Fig. 1</a> belongs to the lathe
family and is known as a vertical boring and turning mill.
This type, as the name implies, is used for boring and turning
operations, and it is very efficient for work within its range.
The part to be machined is held to the table <i>B</i> either by clamps
or in chuck jaws attached to the table. When the machine is
in operation, the table revolves and the turning or boring tools
(which are held in tool-blocks <i>T</i>) remain stationary, except for
the feeding movement. Very often more than one tool is used
at a time, as will be shown later by examples of vertical boring
mill work. The tool-blocks <i>T</i> are inserted in tool-bars <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> carried
by saddles <i>S</i> which are mounted on cross-rail <i>C</i>. Each
tool-head (consisting of a saddle and tool-bar) can be moved
horizontally along cross-rail <i>C</i>, and the tool-bars <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> have a
vertical movement. These movements can be effected either
by hand or power.</p>

<a name="Fig_6_1" id="Fig_6_1"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/251sm.jpg" alt="Gisholt Vertical Boring and Turning Mill" />
<p class="caption750">Fig. 1. Gisholt Vertical Boring and Turning Mill</p>
</div>

<p>When a surface is being turned parallel to the work table,
the entire tool-head moves horizontally along the cross-rail, but
when a cylindrical surface is being turned, the tool-bar moves
vertically. The tool-heads are moved horizontally by the
screws <i>H</i> and <i>H<sub>1</sub></i>, and the vertical feed for the tool-bars is obtained
from the splined shafts <i>V</i> and <i>V<sub>1</sub></i>, there being a separate
screw and shaft for each head so that the feeding movements
are independent. These feed shafts are rotated for the power
feed by vertical shafts <i>A</i> and <i>A<sub>1</sub></i> on each side of the machine.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_243" id="Pg_243">[243]</a></span>
These vertical shafts connect with the feed shafts through bevel
and spur gears located at the ends of the cross-rail. On most
boring mills, connection is made with one of the splined shafts
<i>V</i> or screw <i>H</i>, by a movable gear, which is placed on whichever
shaft will give the desired direction of feed. The particular
machine illustrated is so arranged that either the right
or left screw or feed shaft can be engaged by simply shifting
levers <i>D<sub>1</sub></i> or <i>D</i>.</p>

<p>The amount of feed per revolution of the table is varied for
each tool-head by feed-changing mechanisms <i>F</i> on each side of
the machine. These feed boxes contain gears of different sizes,
and by changing the combinations of these gears, the amount
of feed is varied. Five feed changes are obtained on this machine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_244" id="Pg_244">[244]</a></span>
by shifting lever <i>E</i>, and this number is doubled by shifting
lever <i>G</i>. By having two feed boxes, the feeding movement
of each head can be varied independently. The direction of
either the horizontal or vertical feed can be reversed by lever
<i>R</i>, which is also used for engaging or disengaging the feeds.
This machine is equipped with the dials <i>I</i> and <i>I<sub>1</sub></i> which can be
set to automatically disengage the feed at any predetermined
point. There are also micrometer dials graduated to thousandths
of an inch and used for adjusting the tools without the
use of measuring instruments.</p>

<p>The work table <i>B</i> is driven indirectly from a belt pulley at
the rear, which transmits the power through gearing. The
speed of the table can be varied for turning large or small parts,
by levers <i>J</i> and <i>K</i> and the table can be started, stopped or
rotated part of a revolution by lever <i>L</i> which connects with a
friction clutch. There are corresponding feed and speed levers
on the opposite side, so that the machine can be controlled from
either position.</p>

<p>The heads can be adjusted along the cross-rail for setting the
tools by hand-cranks <i>N</i>, and the tool slides can be moved vertically
by turning shafts <i>V</i> with the same cranks. With this
machine, however, these adjustments do not have to be made
by hand, ordinarily, as there are rapid power movements controlled
by levers <i>M</i>. These levers automatically disengage the
feeds and enable the tool-heads to be rapidly shifted to the required
position, the direction of the movement depending upon
the position of the feed reverse lever <i>R</i> and lever <i>D</i>. This rapid
traverse, which is a feature applied to modern boring mills of
medium and large size, saves time and the labor connected with
hand adjustments. The cross-rail <i>C</i> has a vertical adjustment
on the faces of the right and left housings which support it, in
order to locate the tool-heads at the right height for the work.
This adjustment is effected by power and is controlled by
levers at the sides of the housings. Normally, the cross-rail is
bolted to the housings, and these bolts must be loosened before
making the adjustment, and must always be tightened afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_245" id="Pg_245">[245]</a></span>The function of these different levers has been explained to
show, in a general way, how a vertical boring machine is operated.
It should be understood, however, that the arrangement
differs considerably on machines of other makes. The construction
also varies considerably on machines of the same
make but of different size.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 2. Small Boring and Turning Mill<br />with Single Turret-head</p>
</div>

<p>All modern vertical boring mills of medium and large sizes
are equipped with two tool-heads, as shown in <a href="#Fig_6_1">Fig. 1</a>, because a
great deal of work done on a machine of this type can have two
surfaces machined simultaneously. On the other hand, small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_246" id="Pg_246">[246]</a></span>
mills of the type illustrated in <a href="#Fig_6_2">Fig. 2</a> have a single head. The
toolslide of this machine, instead of having a single tool-block,
carries a five-sided turret <i>T</i> in which different tools can be
mounted. These tools are shifted to the working position as
they are needed, by loosening binder lever <i>L</i> and turning or
&#8220;indexing&#8221; the turret. The turret is located and locked in any
of its five positions by lever <i>I</i>, which controls a plunger that
engages notches at the rear. Frequently, all the tools for
machining a part can be held in the turret, so that little time
is required for changing from one tool to the next. Some large
machines having two tool-heads are also equipped with a turret
on one head.</p>

<a name="Secnum_6_1" id="Secnum_6_1"></a><p><b>Boring and Turning in a Vertical Boring Mill.</b>&mdash;The vertical
boring mill is, in many respects, like a lathe placed in a vertical
position, the table of the mill corresponding to the faceplate
or chuck of the lathe and the tool-head to the lathe carriage.
Much of the work done by a vertical mill could also be machined
in a lathe, but the former is much more efficient for work
within its range. To begin with, it is more convenient to clamp
work to a horizontal table than to the vertical surface of a lathe
faceplate, or, as someone has aptly said, &#8220;It is easier to lay a
piece down than to hang it up.&#8221; This is especially true of the
heavy parts for which the boring mill is principally used. Very
deep roughing cuts can also be taken with a vertical mill. This
type of machine mill is designed for turning and boring work
which, generally speaking, is quite large in diameter in proportion
to the width or height. The work varies greatly,
especially in regard to its diameter, so that boring mills are
built in a large range of sizes. The small and medium sizes
will swing work varying from about 30 inches to 6 or 7 feet in
diameter, whereas large machines, such as are used for turning
very large flywheels, sheaves, etc., have a swing of 16 or 20 feet,
and larger sizes are used in some shops. The size of a vertical
mill, like any other machine tool, should be somewhat in proportion
to the size of the work for which it is intended, as a
very large machine is unwieldy, and, therefore, inefficient for
machining comparatively small parts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_247" id="Pg_247">[247]</a></span>
<a name="Secnum_6_2" id="Secnum_6_2"></a><b>Holding and Setting Work on Boring Mill Table.</b>&mdash;There
are three general methods of holding work to the table of a
boring mill; namely, by the use of chucks, by ordinary bolts
and clamps, or in special fixtures. Chucks which are built into
the table (as illustrated in <a href="#Fig_6_2">Fig. 2</a>) and have both universal and
independent adjustments for the jaws can be used to advantage
for holding castings that are either round or irregular in shape.
The universal adjustment is used for cylindrical parts, such as
disks, flywheels, gear blanks, etc., and the independent adjustment,
for castings of irregular shape. Chucks which have
either an independent or universal movement for the jaws are
known as a &#8220;combination&#8221; type and usually have three jaws.
There is also a four-jaw type which has the independent adjustment
only. This style is preferable for work that is not cylindrical
and which must be held very securely. Chuck jaws that do
not form a part of the machine table, but are bolted to it in the
required position, are also employed extensively, especially on
comparatively large machines.</p>

<p>Most of the work done in a vertical mill is held in a chuck.
Occasionally, however, it is preferable to clamp a part directly
to the table. This may be desirable because of the shape and
size of the work, or because it is necessary to hold a previously
machined surface directly against the table in order to secure
greater accuracy. Sometimes a casting is held in the chuck for
turning one side, and then the finished side is clamped against
the table for turning the opposite side. Parts which are to be
machined in large quantities are often held in special fixtures.
This method is employed when it enables the work to be set up
more quickly than would be possible if regular clamps or chuck
jaws were used.</p>

<a name="Fig_6_3" id="Fig_6_3"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><div class="illobox450"><img src="images/256sm.png" alt="Plan View showing Flywheel Casting Chucked for Turning" /></div>
<p class="caption750">Fig. 3. Plan View showing Flywheel Casting Chucked for Turning</p>
</div>

<p>Work that is to be turned or bored should first be set so that
the part to be machined is about central with the table. For
example, the rim of a flywheel should be set to run true so that
it can be finished by removing about the same amount of metal
around the entire rim; in other words, the rim should be set
concentric with the table, as shown in <a href="#Fig_6_3">Fig. 3</a>, and the sides of
the rim should also be parallel to the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_248" id="Pg_248">[248]</a></span>A simple tool that is very useful for testing the position of
any cylindrical casting consists of a wooden shank into which
is inserted a piece of wire, having one end bent. This tool is
clamped in the toolpost and as the work revolves the wire is
adjusted close to the cylindrical surface being tested. The
movement of the work with relation to the stationary wire point
will, of course, show whether or not the part runs true. The
advantage of using a piece of wire for testing, instead of a rigid
tool, is that the wire, owing to its flexibility, will simply be
bent backward if it is moved too close to a surface which is
considerably out of true. The upper surface of a casting can
be tested for parallelism with the table by using this same
wire gage, or by comparing the surface, as the table is revolved
slowly, with a tool held in the toolpost. An ordinary
surface gage is also used for this purpose. The proper surface
to set true, in any case, depends upon the requirements.
A plain cylindrical disk would be set so that the outside ran
true and the top surface was parallel with the table. When
setting a flywheel, if the inside of the rim is to remain rough,
the casting should be set by this surface rather than by the
outside, so that the rim, when finished, will be uniform in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_249" id="Pg_249">[249]</a></span>
thickness.</p>

<p>As far as possible, chucks should be used for holding cylindrical
parts, owing to their convenience. The jaws should be set
against an interior cylindrical surface whenever this is feasible.
To illustrate, the flywheel in <a href="#Fig_6_3">Fig. 3</a> is gripped by the inside of
the rim which permits the outside to be turned at this setting
of the work. It is also advisable to set a flywheel casting in
the chuck so that a spoke rests against one of the jaws as at
<i>d</i>, if this is possible. This jaw will then act as a driver and prevent
the casting from slipping or turning in the chuck jaws,
owing to the tangential pressure of the turning tool. When a
cut is being taken, the table and work rotate as shown by
arrow <i>a</i>, and the thrust of the cut (taken by tool <i>t</i>) tends to
move the wheel backward against the direction of rotation, as
shown by arrow <i>b</i>. If one of the chuck jaws bears against one
of the spokes, this movement is prevented. It is not always
feasible to use a chuck jaw as a driver and then a special driver
having the form of a small angle-plate or block is sometimes
bolted directly to the table. Another method of driving is to
set a brace between a spoke or projection on the work and a
chuck jaw or strip attached to the table. Drivers are not only
used when turning flywheels, but in connection with any large
casting, especially when heavy cuts have to be taken. Of
course, some castings are so shaped that drivers cannot be
employed.</p>

</div>

<a name="Secnum_6_3" id="Secnum_6_3"></a><p><b>Turning in a Boring Mill.</b>&mdash;The vertical type of boring mill is
used more for turning cylindrical surfaces than for actual boring,
although a large part of the work requires both turning
and boring. We shall first consider, in a general way, how
surfaces are turned and then refer to some boring operations.
The diagram <i>A</i>, <a href="#Fig_6_4">Fig. 4</a>, illustrates how a horizontal surface
would be turned. The tool <i>t</i> is clamped in tool-block <i>t<sub>1</sub></i>, in a
vertical position, and it is fed horizontally as the table and
work rotate. The tool is first adjusted by hand for the proper
depth of cut and the automatic horizontal feed is then engaged.
When a cylindrical surface is to be turned, the tool (provided a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_250" id="Pg_250">[250]</a></span>
straight tool is used) is clamped in a horizontal position and is
fed downward as indicated at <i>B</i>. The amount that the tool
should feed per revolution of the work, depends upon the kind
of material being turned, the diameter of the turned part and
the depth of the cut.</p>

<p>Most of the parts machined in a vertical boring mill are made
of cast iron and, ordinarily, at least one roughing and one finishing
cut is taken. The number of roughing cuts required in any
case depends, of course, upon the amount of metal to be removed.
An ordinary roughing cut in soft cast iron might vary
in depth from <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">8</sub> or <sup class=
"enum">3</sup>/<sub class="denom">16</sub> inch to <sup class="enum">3</sup>/<sub class="denom">8</sub> or <sup class=
"enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">2</sub> inch and the tool would
probably have a feed per revolution of from <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class=
"denom">16</sub> to <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">8</sub> inch, although
deeper cuts and coarser feeds are sometimes taken.
These figures are merely given to show, in a general way, what
cuts and feeds are practicable. The tool used for roughing
usually has a rounded end which leaves a ridged or rough surface.
To obtain a smooth finish, broad flat tools are used. The
flat cutting edge is set parallel to the tool's travel and a coarse
feed is used in order to reduce the time required for taking the
cut. The finishing feeds for cast iron vary from <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class=
"denom">4</sub> to <sup class="enum">3</sup>/<sub class="denom">4</sub> inch on
ordinary work. The different tools used on the vertical mill
will be referred to more in detail later.</p>

<p>All medium and large sized vertical boring mills are equipped
with two tool-heads and two tools are frequently used at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_251" id="Pg_251">[251]</a></span>
same time, especially on large work. <a href="#Fig_6_9">Fig. 9</a> illustrates the use
of two tools simultaneously. The casting shown is a flywheel,
and the tool on the right side turns the upper side of the rim,
while the tool on the left side turns the outside or cylindrical
surface. As a boring mill table rotates in a counter-clockwise
direction, the left-hand tool is reversed to bring the cutting edge
at the rear. By turning two surfaces at once, the total time
for machining the casting is, of course, greatly reduced. The
turning of flywheels is a common vertical boring mill operation,
and this work will be referred to in detail later on.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 5. Tools for Boring and Reaming Holes</p>
</div>

<a name="Secnum_6_4" id="Secnum_6_4"></a><p><b>Boring Operations.</b>&mdash;There are several methods of machining
holes when using a vertical boring mill. Ordinarily, small holes
are cored in castings and it is simply necessary to finish the
rough surface to the required diameter. Some of the tools
used for boring and finishing comparatively small holes are
shown in <a href="#Fig_6_5">Fig. 5</a>. Sketch <i>A</i> shows a boring tool consisting of a
cutter <i>c</i> inserted in a shank, which, in turn, is held in the tool
slide, or in a turret attached to the tool slide. With a tool of
this type, a hole is bored by taking one or more cuts down
through it. The tool shown at <i>B</i> is a four-lipped drill which is
used for drilling cored holes preparatory to finishing by a cutter
or reamer. This drill would probably finish a hole to within
about <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">32</sub> inch of the finish diameter, thus leaving a small amount
of metal for the reamer to remove. The tool illustrated at <i>C</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_252" id="Pg_252">[252]</a></span>
has a double-ended flat cutter <i>c</i>, which cuts on both sides.
These cutters are often made in sets for boring duplicate parts.
Ordinarily, there are two cutters in a set, one being used for
roughing and the other for finishing. The cutter passes through
a rectangular slot in the bar and this particular style is centrally
located by shoulders <i>s</i>, and is held by a taper pin <i>p</i>. Some
cutter bars have an extension end, or &#8220;pilot&#8221; as it is called,
which passes through a close-fitting bushing in the table to
steady the bar. Sketch <i>D</i> shows a finishing reamer. This tool
takes a very light cut and is intended to finish holes that have
been previously bored close to the required size. Sometimes a
flat cutter <i>C</i> is used for roughing and a reamer for finishing.
The reamer is especially desirable for interchangeable work,
when all holes must have a smooth finish and be of the same
diameter. When a reamer is held rigidly to a turret or toolslide,
it is liable to produce a hole that is either tapering or
larger than the reamer diameter. To prevent this, the reamer
should be held in a &#8220;floating&#8221; holder which, by means of a
slight adjustment, allows the reamer to align itself with the
hole. There are several methods of securing this &#8220;floating&#8221;
movement. (See &#8220;<a href="#Secnum_6_11">Floating Reamer Holders</a>.&#8221;)</p>

<p>Large holes or interior cylindrical surfaces are bored by tools
held in the regular tool-head. The tool is sometimes clamped
in a horizontal position as shown at <i>A</i>, <a href="#Fig_6_6">Fig. 6</a>, or a bent type is
used as at <i>B</i>. Cast iron is usually finished by a broad flat tool
as at <i>C</i>, the same as when turning exterior surfaces. Obviously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_253" id="Pg_253">[253]</a></span>
a hole that is bored in this way must be large enough to admit
the tool-block.</p>

<a name="Secnum_6_5" id="Secnum_6_5"></a><p><b>Turning Tools for the Vertical Boring Mill.</b>&mdash;A set of turning
tools for the vertical boring mill is shown in <a href="#Fig_6_7">Fig. 7</a>. These
tools can be used for a wide variety of ordinary turning operations.
When a great many duplicate parts are to be machined,
special tool equipment can often be used to advantage, but as
the form of this equipment depends upon the character of the
work, only standard tools have been shown in this illustration.
The tool shown at <i>A</i> is a right-hand, roughing tool, and a left-hand
tool of the same type is shown at <i>B</i>. Tool <i>C</i> is an offset
or bent, left-hand round nose for roughing, and <i>D</i> is a right-hand
offset roughing tool. A straight round nose is shown
at <i>E</i>. Tool <i>F</i> has a flat, broad cutting edge and is used for
finishing. Left-and right-hand finishing tools of the offset<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_254" id="Pg_254">[254]</a></span>
type are shown at <i>G</i> and <i>H</i>, respectively. Tool <i>I</i> has a square
end and is used for cutting grooves. Right-and left-hand
parting tools are shown at <i>J</i> and <i>K</i>, and tool <i>L</i> is a form frequently
used for rounding corners.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 8. Diagrams Illustrating Use of Different Forms of Tools</p>
</div>

<p>The diagrams in <a href="#Fig_6_8">Fig. 8</a> show, in a general way, how each of
the tools illustrated in <a href="#Fig_6_7">Fig. 7</a> are used, and corresponding tools
are marked by the same reference letters in both of these illustrations.
The right-and left-hand roughing tools <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are
especially adapted for taking deep roughing cuts. One feeds
away from the center of the table, or to the right (when held in
the right-hand tool-block) and the other tool is ground to feed
in the opposite direction. Ordinarily, when turning plain flat
surfaces, the cut is started at the outside and the tool feeds
toward the center, as at <i>B</i>, although it is sometimes more convenient
to feed in the opposite direction, as at <i>A</i>, especially when
there is a rim or other projecting part at the outside edge. The
tool shown at <i>A</i> could also be used for turning cylindrical
surfaces, by clamping it in a horizontal position across the bottom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_255" id="Pg_255">[255]</a></span>
of the tool-block. The feeding movement would then be
downward or at right-angles to the work table.</p>

<p>The offset round-nose tools <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> are for turning exterior
or interior cylinder surfaces. The shank of this tool is clamped
in the tool-block in a vertical position and as the bent end extends
below the tool-block, it can be fed down close to a shoulder.
The straight type shown at <i>E</i> is commonly used for turning steel
or iron, and when the point is drawn out narrower, it is also
used for brass, although the front is then ground without slope.
Tool <i>F</i> is for light finishing cuts and broad feeds. The amount
of feed per revolution of the work should always be less than
the width of the cutting edge as otherwise ridges will be left
on the turned surface. The offset tools <i>G</i> and <i>H</i> are for finishing
exterior and interior cylindrical surfaces. These tools also
have both vertical and horizontal cutting edges and are sometimes
used for first finishing a cylindrical and then a horizontal
surface, or <i>vice versa</i>. Tool <i>I</i> is adapted to such work as cutting
packing-ring grooves in engine pistons, forming square or rectangular
grooves, and similar work. The parting tools <i>J</i> and
<i>K</i> can also be used for forming narrow grooves or for cutting
off rings, etc. The sketch <i>K</i> (<a href="#Fig_6_8">Fig. 8</a>) indicates how a tool of
this kind might be used for squaring a corner under a shoulder.
Tool <i>L</i> is frequently used on boring mills for rounding the
corners of flywheel rims, in order to give them a more finished
appearance. It has two cutting edges so that either side can
be used as when rounding the inner and outer corners of a rim.</p>

<p>The turning tools of a vertical boring mill are similar, in
many respects, to those used in a lathe, although the shanks of
the former are shorter and more stocky than those of lathe
tools. The cutting edges of some of the tools also differ somewhat
in form, but the principles which govern the grinding of
lathe and boring mill tools are identical, and those who are
not familiar with tool grinding are referred to <a href="#Chapnum_2">Chapter II</a>, in
which this subject is treated.</p>

<a name="Secnum_6_6" id="Secnum_6_6"></a><p><b>Turning a Flywheel on a Vertical Mill.</b>&mdash;The turning of a
flywheel is a good example of the kind of work for which a vertical
boring mill is adapted. A flywheel should preferably be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_256" id="Pg_256">[256]</a></span>
machined on a double-head mill so that one side and the periphery
of the rim can be turned at the same time. A common method
of holding a flywheel is shown in <a href="#Fig_6_9">Fig. 9</a>. The rim is gripped by
four chuck jaws <i>D</i> which, if practicable, should be on the inside
where they will not interfere with the movement of the tool.
Two of the jaws, in this case, are set against the spokes on opposite
sides of the wheel, to act as drivers and prevent any
backward shifting of work when a heavy cut is being taken.
The illustration shows the tool to the right rough turning the
side of the rim, while the left-hand tool turns the periphery.
Finishing cuts are also taken over the rim, at this setting, and
the hub is turned on the outside, faced on top, and the hole
bored.</p>

<p>The three tools <i>A</i>, <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, for finishing the hole, are mounted
in the turret. Bar <i>A</i>, which carries a cutter at its end, first
rough bores the hole. The sizing cutter <i>B</i> is then used to
straighten it before inserting the finishing reamer <i>C</i>. <a href="#Fig_6_10">Fig. 10</a>
shows the turret moved over to a central position and the sizing
cutter <i>B</i> set for boring. The head is centrally located (on this
particular machine) by a positive center-stop. The turret is indexed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_257" id="Pg_257">[257]</a></span>
for bringing the different tools into the working position,
by loosening the clamping lever <i>L</i> and pulling down lever <i>I</i>
which disengages the turret lock-pin. When all the flywheels
in a lot have been machined as described, the opposite side is
finished.</p>

<p>In order to show more clearly the method of handling work of
this class, the machining of a flywheel will be explained more in
detail in connection with <a href="#Fig_6_11">Fig. 11</a>, which illustrates practically
the same equipment as is shown in <a href="#Fig_6_9">Figs. 9</a> and <a href="#Fig_6_10">10</a>. The successive
order in which the various operations are performed is
as follows: Tool <i>a</i> (see sketch <i>A</i>) rough turns the side of the
rim, while tool <i>b</i>, which is set with its cutting edge toward the
rear, rough turns the outside. The direction of the feeding
movement for each tool is indicated by the arrows. When tool
<i>a</i> has crossed the rim, it is moved over for facing the hub, as
shown by the dotted lines. The side and periphery of the rim
are next finished by the broad-nose finishing tools <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> (see
sketch <i>B</i>). The feed should be increased for finishing, so that
each tool will have a movement of say <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">4</sub> or
<sup class="enum">3</sup>/<sub class="denom">8</sub> inch per revolution
of the work, and the cuts should, at least, be deep enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_259" id="Pg_259">[259]</a></span>
remove the marks made by the roughing tools. Tool <i>c</i> is also
used for finishing the hub as indicated by the dotted lines.
After these cuts are taken, the outside of the hub and inner
surface of the rim are usually turned down as far as the spokes,
by using offset tools similar to the ones shown at <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> in
<a href="#Fig_6_7">Fig. 7</a>. The corners of the rim and hub are also rounded to
give the work a more finished appearance, by using a tool <i>L</i>.</p>

<p>The next operation is that of finishing the hole through the
hub. The hard scale is first removed by a roughing cutter <i>r</i>
(sketch <i>C</i>), which is followed by a &#8220;sizing&#8221; cutter <i>s</i>. The hole
is then finished smooth and to the right diameter by reamer <i>f</i>.
The bars carrying cutters <i>r</i> and <i>s</i> have extensions or &#8220;pilots&#8221;
which enter a close-fitting bushing in the table, in order to
steady the bar and hold it in alignment.</p>

<p>When the hole is finished, the wheel is turned over, so that
the lower side of the rim and hub can be faced. The method
of holding the casting for the final operation is shown at <i>D</i>.
The chuck jaws are removed, and the finished side of the rim is
clamped against parallels <i>p</i> resting on the table. The wheel is
centrally located for turning this side by a plug <i>e</i> which is inserted
in a hole in the table and fits the bore of the hub. The
wheel is held by clamps which bear against the spokes. Roughing
and finishing cuts are next taken over the top surface of the
rim and hub and the corners are rounded, which completes the
machining operations. If the rim needs to be a certain width,
about the same amount of metal should be removed from each
side, unless sandy spots or &#8220;blow-holes&#8221; in the casting make it
necessary to take more from one side than from the other. That
side of the rim which was up in the mold when the casting was
made should be turned first, because the porous, spongy spots
usually form on the &#8220;cope&#8221; or top side of a casting.</p>

<a name="Secnum_6_7" id="Secnum_6_7"></a><p><b>Convex Turning Attachment for Boring Mills.</b>&mdash;<a href="#Fig_6_12">Fig. 12</a>
shows a vertical boring mill arranged for turning pulleys having
convex rims; that is, the rim, instead of being cylindrical, is
rounded somewhat so that it slopes from the center toward
either side. (The reason for turning a pulley rim convex is to
prevent the belt from running off at one side, as it sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_260" id="Pg_260">[260]</a></span>
tends to do when a cylindrical pulley is used.) The convex
surface is produced by a special attachment which causes the
turning tool to gradually move outward as it feeds down, until
the center of the rim is reached, after which the movement is
inward.</p>

<p>The particular attachment shown in <a href="#Fig_6_12">Fig. 12</a> consists of a
special box-shaped tool-head <i>F</i> containing a sliding holder <i>G</i>, in
which the tool is clamped by set-screws passing through elongated
slots in the front of the tool-head. In addition, there is
a radius link <i>L</i> which swivels on a stud at the rear of the tool-head
and is attached to vertical link <i>H</i>. Link <i>L</i> is so connected
to the sliding tool-block that any downward movement of the
tool-bar <i>I</i> causes the tool to move outward until the link is in
a horizontal position, after which the movement is reversed.
When the attachment is first set up, the turning tool is placed
at the center of the rim and then link <i>L</i> is clamped to the vertical
link while in a horizontal position. The cut is started at
the top edge of the rim, and the tool is fed downward by power,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_261" id="Pg_261">[261]</a></span>
the same as when turning a cylindrical surface. The amount of
curvature or convexity of a rim can be varied by inserting the
clamp bolt <i>J</i> in different holes in link <i>L</i>.</p>

<p>The tools for machining the hub and sides of the rim are held
in a turret mounted on the left-hand head, as shown. The
special tool-holder <i>A</i> contains two bent tools for turning the
upper and lower edges of the pulley rim at the same time as
the tool-head is fed horizontally. Roughing and finishing tools
<i>B</i> are for facing the hub, and the tools <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>, and <i>E</i> rough bore,
finish bore, and ream the hole for the shaft.</p>

<a name="Secnum_6_8" id="Secnum_6_8"></a><p><b>Turning Taper or Conical Surfaces.</b>&mdash;Conical or taper surfaces
are turned in a vertical boring mill by swiveling the tool-bar

given in degrees, the tool-bar can be set by graduations on the
edge of the circular base <i>B</i>, which show the angle <i>a</i> to which the
bar is swiveled from a vertical position. The base turns on a
central stud and is secured to the saddle <i>S</i> by the bolts shown,
which should be tightened after the tool-bar is set. The vertical
power feed can be used for taper turning the same as for
cylindrical work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_262" id="Pg_262">[262]</a></span>
Occasionally it is necessary to machine a conical surface which
has such a large included angle that the tool-bar cannot be
swiveled far enough around to permit turning by the method
illustrated in <a href="#Fig_6_13">Fig. 13</a>. Another method, which is sometimes resorted
to for work of this class, is to use the combined vertical
and horizontal feeds. Suppose we want to turn the conical
casting <i>W</i> (<a href="#Fig_6_14">Fig. 14</a>), to an angle of 30 degrees, as shown, and
that the tool-head of the boring mill moves horizontally <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">4</sub> inch
per turn of the feed-screw and has a vertical movement of <sup class="enum">3</sup>/<sub class="denom">16</sub>
inch per turn of the upper feed-shaft. If the two feeds are
used simultaneously, the tool will move a distance <i>h</i> of say 8
inches, while it moves downward a distance <i>v</i> of 6 inches, thus
turning the surface to an angle <i>y</i>. This angle is greater (as
measured from a horizontal plane) than the angle required, but,
if the tool-bar is swiveled to an angle <i>x</i>, the tool, as it moves
downward, will also be advanced horizontally, in addition to
the regular horizontal movement. The result is that the angle
<i>y</i> is diminished and if the tool-bar is set over the right amount,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_263" id="Pg_263">[263]</a></span>
the conical surface can be turned to an angle <i>a</i> of 30 degrees.
The problem, then, is to determine what the angle <i>x</i> should be
for turning to a given angle <i>a</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><div class="illobox450"><img src="images/271sm.png" alt="Diagram showing Method of Obtaining Angular Position of Tool-head when Turning Conical Surfaces by using Vertical and Horizontal Feeding Movements" /></div>
<p class="caption750">Fig. 15. Diagram showing Method of Obtaining Angular Position<br />of Tool-head
when Turning Conical Surfaces by using Vertical and<br />Horizontal
Feeding Movements</p>
</div>

<p>The way angle <i>x</i> is calculated will be explained in connection
with the enlarged diagram, <a href="#Fig_6_15">Fig. 15</a>, which shows one-half of the
casting. The sine of the known angle <i>a</i> is first found in a table
of natural sines. Then the sine of angle <i>b</i>, between the taper
surface and center-line of the tool-head, is determined as follows:
sin&nbsp;<i>b</i> = (sin&nbsp;<i>a</i>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<i>h</i>)&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;<i>v</i>, in which <i>h</i> represents the rate
of horizontal
feed and <i>v</i> the rate of vertical feed. The angle corresponding
to sine <i>b</i> is next found in a table of sines. We now
have angles <i>b</i> and <i>a</i>, and by subtracting the sum of these angles
from 90 degrees, the desired angle <i>x</i> is obtained. To illustrate:</p>

<p>The sine of 30 degrees is 0.5; then sin <i>b</i> = (0.5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class=
"denom">4</sub>)&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;<sup class="enum">3</sup>/<sub class="denom">16</sub> = 0.6666;
hence angle <i>b</i> = 41 degrees 49 minutes, and <i>x</i> = 90&deg;&nbsp;- (30&deg;&nbsp;+
41&deg; 49') = 18 degrees 11 minutes. Hence to turn the casting to
angle <i>a</i> in a boring mill having the horizontal and vertical feeds
given, the tool-head would be set over from the vertical 18 degrees
and 11 minutes which is equivalent to about 18<sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">6</sub> degrees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_264" id="Pg_264">[264]</a></span>
If the required angle <i>a</i> were greater than angle <i>y</i> obtained
from the combined feeds with the tool-bar in a vertical position,
it would then be necessary to swing the lower end of the bar to
the left rather than to the right of a vertical plane. When the
required angle <i>a</i> exceeds angle <i>y</i>, the sum of angles <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> is
greater than 90 degrees so that angle <i>x</i> for the tool-head =
(<i>a</i>&nbsp;+ <i>b</i>)&nbsp;- 90 degrees.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/273sm.jpg" alt="Bullard Vertical Turret Lathe" />
<p class="caption750">Fig. 16. Bullard Vertical Turret Lathe</p>
</div>

<a name="Secnum_6_9" id="Secnum_6_9"></a><p><b>Turret-lathe Type of Vertical Boring Mill.</b>&mdash;The machine
illustrated in <a href="#Fig_6_16">Fig. 16</a> was designed to combine the advantages of
the horizontal turret lathe and the vertical boring mill. It is
known as a &#8220;vertical turret lathe,&#8221; but resembles, in many
respects, a vertical boring mill. This machine has a turret on
the cross-rail the same as many vertical boring mills, and, in
addition, a side-head <i>S</i>. The side-head has a vertical feeding
movement, and the tool-bar <i>T</i> can be fed horizontally. The
tool-bar is also equipped with a four-sided turret for holding
turning tools. This arrangement of the tool-heads makes it
possible to use two tools simultaneously upon comparatively
small work. When both heads are mounted on the cross-rail,
as with a double-head boring mill, it is often impossible to
machine certain parts to advantage, because one head interferes
with the other.</p>

<p>The drive to the table (for the particular machine illustrated)
is from a belt pulley at the rear, and fifteen speed changes are
available. Five changes are obtained by turning the pilot-wheel
<i>A</i> and this series of five speeds is compounded three
times by turning lever <i>B</i>. Each spoke of pilot-wheel <i>A</i> indicates
a speed which is engaged only when the spoke is in a
vertical position, and the three positions for <i>B</i> are indicated,
by slots in the disk shown. The number of table revolutions
per minute for different positions of pilot-wheel <i>A</i> and lever
<i>B</i> are shown by figures seen through whichever slot is at <i>C</i>.
There are five rows of figures corresponding to the five spokes
of the pilot-wheel and three figures in a row, and the speed
is shown by arrows on the sides of the slots. The segment
disk containing these figures also serves as an interlocking
device which prevents moving more than one speed controlling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_265" id="Pg_265">[265]</a></span>
lever at a time, in order to avoid damaging the driving
mechanism.</p>

<p>The feeding movement for each head is independent. Lever
<i>D</i> controls the engagement or disengagement of the vertical or
cross feeds for the head on the cross-rail. The feed for the
side-head is controlled by lever <i>E</i>. When this lever is pushed
inward, the entire head feeds vertically, but when it is pulled
out, the tool-bar feeds horizontally. These two feeds can be
disengaged by placing the lever in a neutral position. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_266" id="Pg_266">[266]</a></span>
direction of the feeding movement for either head can be reversed
by lever <i>R</i>. The amount of feed is varied by feed-wheel
<i>F</i> and clutch-rod <i>G</i>. When lever <i>E</i> is in the neutral
position, the side-head or tool-bar can be adjusted by the hand-cranks
<i>H</i> and <i>I</i>, respectively. The cross-rail head and its
turret slide have rapid power traverse movements for making
quick adjustments. This rapid traverse is controlled by the
key-handles <i>J</i>.</p>

<p>The feed-screws for the vertical head have micrometer dials
<i>K</i> for making accurate adjustments. There are also large dials
at <i>L</i> which indicate vertical movements of the side head and
horizontal movements of the tool slide. All of these dials have
small adjustable clips <i>c</i> which are numbered to correspond to
numbers on the faces of the respective turrets. These clips or
&#8220;observation stops&#8221; are used in the production of duplicate
parts. For example, suppose a tool in face No. 1 for the main
turret is set for a given diameter and height of shoulder on a
part which is to be duplicated. To obtain the same setting of
the tools for the next piece, clips No. 1, on both the vertical
feed rod and screw dials, are placed opposite the graduations
which are intersected by stationary pointers secured to the cross-rail.
The clips are set in this way after the first part has been
machined to the required size and before disturbing the final
position of the tools. For turning a duplicate part, the tools
are simply brought to the same position by turning the feed
screws until the clips and stationary pointers again coincide.
For setting tools on other faces of either turret, this operation
is repeated, except that clips are used bearing numbers corresponding
to the turret face in use.</p>

<p>The main turret of this machine has five holes in which are
inserted the necessary boring and turning tools, drills or reamers,
as may be required. By having all the tools mounted in the
turret, they can be quickly and accurately set in the working
position. When the turret is indexed from one face to the next,
binder lever <i>N</i> is first loosened. The turret then moves forward,
away from its seat, thus disengaging the indexing and registering
pins which accurately locate it in any one of the five positions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_267" id="Pg_267">[267]</a></span>
The turret is revolved by turning crank <i>M</i>, one turn of
this handle moving the turret <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">5</sub> revolution or from one hole to
the next. The side-head turret is turned by loosening lever <i>O</i>.
The turret slide can be locked rigidly in any position by lever
<i>P</i> and its saddle is clamped to the cross-rail by lever <i>Q</i>. The
binder levers for the saddle and toolslide of the side-head are
located at <i>U</i> and <i>V</i>, respectively. A slide that does not require
feeding movements is locked in order to obtain greater rigidity.
To illustrate, if the main tool slide were to feed vertically and
not horizontally, it might be advisable to lock the saddle to the
cross-rail, while taking the vertical cut.</p>

<p>The vertical slide can be set at an angle for taper turning,
and the turret is accurately located over the center of the table
for boring or reaming, by a positive center stop. The machine is
provided with a brake for stopping the work table quickly, which
is operated by lifting the shaft of pilot-wheel <i>A</i>. The side-and
cross-rails are a unit and are adjusted together to accommodate
work of different heights. This adjustment is effected by power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_268" id="Pg_268">[268]</a></span>
on the particular machine illustrated, and it is controlled by a
lever near the left end of the cross-rail. Before making this
adjustment, all binder bolts which normally hold the rails rigidly
to the machine column must be released, and care should be
taken to tighten them after the adjustment is made.</p>

<a name="Secnum_6_10" id="Secnum_6_10"></a><p><b>Examples of Vertical Turret Lathe Work.</b>&mdash;In order to illustrate
how a vertical turret lathe is used, one or two examples of
work will be referred to in detail. These examples also indicate,
in a general way, the class of work for which this type of machine
is adapted. <a href="#Fig_6_17">Fig. 17</a> shows how a cast-iron gear blank is machined.
The work is gripped on the inside of the rim by three
chuck jaws, and all of the tools required for the various operations
are mounted in the main and side turrets. The illustration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_269" id="Pg_269">[269]</a></span>
shows the first operation which is that of rough turning the
hub, the top side of the blank and its periphery. The tools <i>A</i>
for facing the hub and upper surface are both held in one tool-block
on the main turret, and tool <i>A<sub>1</sub></i> for roughing the periphery
is in the side turret. With this arrangement, the three surfaces
can be turned simultaneously.</p>

<p>The main turret is next indexed one-sixth of a revolution
which brings the broad finishing tools <i>B</i> into position, and the
side turret is also turned to locate finishing tool <i>B<sub>1</sub></i> at the front.
(The indexing of the main turret on this particular machine is
effected by loosening binder lever n and raising the turret lock-pin
by means of lever <i>p</i>.) The hub, side and periphery of the
blank are then finished. When tools <i>B</i> are clamped in the tool-blocks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_270" id="Pg_270">[270]</a></span>
they are, of course, set for turning the hub to the required
height. The third operation is performed by the tools at <i>C</i>, one
of which &#8220;breaks&#8221; or chamfers the corner of the cored hole in
the hub, to provide a starting surface for drill <i>D</i>, and the other
turns the outside of the hub, after the chamfering tool is removed.
The four-lipped shell-drill <i>D</i> is next used to drill the cored hole
and then this hole is bored close to the finished size and concentric
with the circumference of the blank by boring tool <i>E</i>,
which is followed by the finishing reamer <i>F</i>. When the drill,
boring tool and reamer are being used, the turret is set over the
center or axis of the table, by means of a positive center stop
on the left-side of the turret saddle. If it is necessary to move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_271" id="Pg_271">[271]</a></span>
the turret beyond the central position, this stop can be swung
out of the way.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_6_18">Figs. 18</a> and <a href="#Fig_6_19">19</a> illustrate the turning of an automobile flywheel,
which is another typical example of work for a machine
of this type. The flywheel is finished in two settings. Its
position for the first series of operations is shown in <a href="#Fig_6_18">Fig. 18</a>, and
the successive order of the four operations for the first setting
is shown by the diagrams, <a href="#Fig_6_20">Fig. 20</a>. The first operation requires
four tools which act simultaneously. The three held in tool-block
<i>A</i> of the turret, face the hub, the web and the rim of the
flywheel, while tool <i>a</i> in the side-head rough turns the outside
diameter. The outside diameter is also finished by broad-nosed
tool <i>b</i> which is given a coarse feed. In the second operation,
the under face of the rim is finished by tool <i>c</i>, the outer
corners are rounded by tool <i>d</i> and the inner surface of the rim
is rough turned by a bent tool <i>B</i>, which is moved into position
by indexing the main turret. In the third operation, the side-head
is moved out of the way and the inside of the rim is finished
by another bent tool <i>B<sub>1</sub></i>. The final operation at this setting is
the boring of the central hole, which is done with a bar <i>C</i> having
interchangeable cutters which make it possible to finish the hole
at one setting of the turret.</p>

<p>The remaining operations are performed on the opposite side
of the work which is held in &#8220;soft&#8221; jaws <i>J</i> accurately bored to
fit the finished outside diameter as indicated in <a href="#Fig_6_19">Fig. 19</a>. The
tool in the main turret turns the inside of the rim, and the side-head
is equipped with two tools for facing the web and hub
simultaneously. As the tool in the main turret operates on the
left side of the rim, it is set with the cutting edge toward the
rear. In order to move the turret to this position, which is beyond
the center of the table, the center stop previously referred
to is swung out of the way.</p>

<a name="Secnum_6_11" id="Secnum_6_11"></a><p><b>Floating Reamer Holders.</b>&mdash;If a reamer is held rigidly in the
turret of a boring mill or turret lathe, it is liable to produce a
hole which tapers slightly or is too large. When a hole is bored
with a single-point boring tool, it is concentric with the axis of
rotation, and if a reamer that is aligned exactly with the bored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_272" id="Pg_272">[272]</a></span>
hole is fed into the work, the finished hole should be cylindrical
and the correct size. It is very difficult, however, to locate a
reamer exactly in line with a bored hole, because of slight variations
in the indexing of the turret, or errors resulting from wear
of the guiding ways or other important parts of the machine.</p>

<p>To prevent inaccuracies due to this cause, reamers are often
held in what is known as a &#8220;floating&#8221; holder. This type of
holder is so arranged that the reamer, instead of being held
rigidly, is allowed a slight free or floating movement so that it
can follow a hole which has been bored true, without restraint.
In this way the hole is reamed straight and to practically the
same size as the reamer.</p>

<a name="Fig_6_21" id="Fig_6_21"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><div class="illobox450"><img src="images/280sm.png" alt="Two Types of Floating Reamer Holders" /></div>
<p class="caption750">Fig. 21. Two Types of Floating Reamer Holders</p>
</div>

<p>There are many different designs of floating holders but the
general principle upon which they are based is illustrated by
the two types shown in <a href="#Fig_6_21">Fig. 21</a>. The reamer and holder shown
to the left has a ball-shank <i>A</i> which bears against a backing-up
screw <i>B</i> inserted in the end of holder <i>C</i> through which the driving
pin passes. The lower end of the reamer shank is also
spherical-shaped at <i>D</i>, and screw-pin <i>E</i> secures the shell reamer
to this end. It will be noted that the hole in the shank for pin
<i>E</i> is &#8220;bell-mouthed&#8221; on each side of the center and that
there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_273" id="Pg_273">[273]</a></span>
is clearance at <i>F</i> between the shank and reamer shell; hence the
reamer has a free floating action in any direction. This holder
has given very satisfactory results.</p>

<p>The holder shown to the right is attached to the face of the
turret by four fillister-head screws. Sleeve <i>C</i> is held in plate <i>A</i>
by means of two steel pins <i>B</i> which are tight in plate <i>A</i> and made
to fit freely in bayonet grooves <i>D</i>. Reamer holder <i>E</i> floats on
sleeve <i>C</i>, the floating motion being obtained through the four
steel pins <i>G</i> extending into driving ring <i>F</i>. Two of the pins are
tight in the holder <i>E</i> and two in sleeve <i>C</i>. The faces of sleeve
<i>C</i>, driving ring <i>F</i>, and reamer holder <i>E</i> are held tightly against
each other by means of spring <i>H</i> which insures the reamer being
held perfectly true. Spring <i>H</i> is adjusted by means of nut <i>I</i>
which is turned with a spanner wrench furnished with each
holder. The reamer is so held that its axis is always maintained
parallel to the center of the hole, and, at the same time, it has
a slight self-adjusting tendency radially, so that the hole and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_274" id="Pg_274">[274]</a></span>
reamer will automatically keep in perfect alignment with each
other.</p>

</div>

<a name="Secnum_6_12" id="Secnum_6_12"></a><p><b>Multiple Cylinder Boring Machine.</b>&mdash;In automobile and
other factories where a great many gasoline engine cylinders are
required, multiple-spindle boring machines of the vertical type
are commonly used. The machine shown in <a href="#Fig_6_22">Fig. 22</a> is a special
design for boring four cylinders which are cast <i>en bloc</i> or in one
solid casting. The work is held in a box jig which has a top
plate equipped with guide bearings for holding the spindles
rigidly while boring. The lower end of each spindle has attached
to it a cutter-head and the boring is done by feeding the table
and casting vertically. This feeding movement is effected by
power and it is disengaged automatically when the cutters have
bored to the required depth. The particular machine illustrated
is used for rough boring only, the cylinders being finished
by reaming in another similar machine. The cylinders are
bored to a diameter of 3<sup class="enum">5</sup>/<sub class="denom">8</sub> inches, and about
<sup class="enum">3</sup>/<sub class="denom">8</sub> inch of metal is
removed by the roughing cut. The spindles have fixed center-to-center
distances as the machine is intended for constant use
on cylinders of one size, so that adjustment is not necessary.
Of course, a special machine of this kind is only used in shops
where large numbers of cylinders of one design are required
continually. Some cylinder boring machines of the vertical type
have spindles which can be adjusted for different center-to-center
distances if this should be necessary in order to accommodate
a cylinder of another size.</p>

<h3>HORIZONTAL BORING MACHINES</h3>
<hr class="c05" />

<p>A boring machine of the horizontal type is shown in <a href="#Fig_7_1">Fig. 1</a>.
The construction and operation of this machine is very different
from that of a vertical boring mill and it is also used for an
entirely different class of work. The horizontal machine is
employed principally for boring, drilling or milling, whereas the
vertical design is especially adapted to turning and boring.
The horizontal type is also used for turning or facing flanges
or similar surfaces when such an operation can be performed to
advantage in connection with other machine work on the same
part.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/284sm.jpg" alt="Lucas Horizontal Boring, Drilling and Milling Machine" />
<p class="caption750">Fig. 1. Lucas Horizontal Boring, Drilling and Milling Machine</p>
</div>

<p>The type of machine illustrated in <a href="#Fig_7_1">Fig. 1</a> has a heavy base or
bed to which is bolted the column <i>C</i> having vertical ways on
which the spindle-head <i>H</i> is mounted. This head contains a
sleeve or quill in which the spindle <i>S</i> slides longitudinally.
The spindle carries cutters for boring, whereas milling cutters
or the auxiliary facing arm are bolted to the end <i>A</i> of the
spindle sleeve. The work itself is attached either directly or
indirectly to the table or platen <i>P</i>. When the machine is in
operation, the cutter or tool revolves with the spindle sleeve
or spindle and either the cutter or the part being machined is
given a feeding movement, depending on the character of the
work. The spindle can be moved in or out by hand for adjustment,
or by power for feeding the cutter, as when boring or
drilling.</p>

<p>The entire spindle-head <i>H</i> can also be moved vertically on
the face of the column <i>C</i>, by hand, for setting the spindle to the
proper height, or by power for feeding a milling cutter in a
vertical direction. When the vertical position of the spindle-head
is changed, the outboard bearing block <i>B</i> also moves
up or down a corresponding amount, the two parts being connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_277" id="Pg_277">[277]</a></span>
by shafts and gearing. Block <i>B</i> steadies the outer end
of the boring-bar and the back-rest in which this block is
mounted can be shifted along the bed to suit the length of the
work, by turning the squared end of shaft <i>D</i> with a crank.
The platen <i>P</i> has a cross-feed, and the saddle <i>E</i> on which it is
mounted can be traversed lengthwise on the bed; both of these
movements can also be effected by hand or power. There is a
series of power feeding movements for the cutters and, in addition,
rapid power movements <i>in a reverse direction from the
feed</i> for returning a cutter quickly to its starting position, when
this is desirable.</p>

<p>This machine is driven by a belt connecting pulley <i>G</i> with an
overhead shaft. When the machine is in operation, this pulley
is engaged with the main driving shaft by a friction clutch <i>F</i>
controlled by lever <i>L</i>. This main shaft drives through gearing
a vertical shaft <i>I</i>, which by means of other gears in the spindle-head
imparts a rotary movement to the spindle. As a machine
of this type is used for boring holes of various diameters and
for a variety of other work, it is necessary to have a number
of speed changes for the spindle. Nine speeds are obtained by
changing the position of the sliding gears controlled by levers
<i>R</i> and this number is doubled by back-gears in the spindle-head
and controlled by lever <i>J</i>.</p>

<p>The amount of feed for the spindle, spindle-head, platen or
saddle is varied by two levers <i>K</i> and <i>K<sub>1</sub></i> which control the position
of sliding gears through which the feeding movements are
transmitted. The direction of the feed can be reversed by shifting
lever <i>O</i>. With this particular machine, nine feed changes
are available for each position of the spindle back-gears, making
a total of eighteen changes. The feeding movement is transmitted
to the spindle-head, spindle, platen or saddle, as required,
by the three distributing levers <i>T</i>, <i>U</i> and <i>V</i>, which control
clutches connecting with the transmission shafts or feed
screws. When lever <i>T</i> is turned to the left, the longitudinal
power feed for the spindle is engaged, whereas turning it to the
right throws in the vertical feed for the spindle-head. Lever <i>U</i>
engages the cross-feed for platen <i>P</i> and lever <i>V</i>, the longitudinal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_278" id="Pg_278">[278]</a></span>
feed for saddle <i>E</i>. These levers have a simple but ingenious
interlocking device which makes it impossible to engage more
than one feed at a time. For example, if lever <i>T</i> is set for feeding
the spindle, levers <i>U</i> and <i>V</i> are locked against movement.</p>

<p>The feeds are started and stopped by lever <i>M</i> which also
engages the rapid power traverse when thrown in the opposite
direction. This rapid traverse operates for whatever feed is
engaged by the distributing levers and, as before stated, in a
reverse direction. For example, if the reverse lever <i>O</i> is set for
feeding the spindle to the right, the rapid traverse would be to
the left, and <i>vice versa</i>. The cross-feed for the platen can be
automatically tripped at any point by setting an adjustable
stop in the proper position and the feed can also be tripped by
a hand lever at the side of the platen.</p>

<p>All the different feeding movements can be effected by hand
as well as by power. By means of handwheel <i>N</i>, the spindle
can be moved in or out slowly, for feeding a cutter by hand.
When the friction clamp <i>Q</i> is loosened, the turnstile <i>W</i> can be
used for traversing the spindle, in case a hand adjustment is desirable.
The spindle-head can be adjusted vertically by turning
squared shaft <i>X</i> with a crank, and the saddle can be shifted
along the bed by turning shaft <i>Y</i>. The hand adjustment of the
platen is effected by shaft <i>Z</i>. The spindle-head, platen and
saddle can also be adjusted from the end of the machine, when
this is more convenient. Shafts <i>X</i>, <i>Y</i> and <i>Z</i> are equipped with
micrometer dials which are graduated to show movements of
one-thousandth inch. These dials are used for accurately adjusting
the spindle or work and for boring holes or milling
surfaces that must be an exact distance apart.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 2. Horizontal Boring and Drilling Machine with Vertical Table Adjustment</p>
</div>

<a name="Secnum_7_1" id="Secnum_7_1"></a><p><b>Horizontal Boring Machine with Vertical Table Adjustment.</b>&mdash;Another
horizontal boring machine is partly shown in <a href="#Fig_7_2">Fig. 2</a>.
This machine is of the same type as that illustrated in Fig. 1,
but its construction is quite different, as will be seen. The spindle
cannot be adjusted vertically as with the first design described, but
it is mounted and driven very much like the spindle of a lathe,
and adjustment for height is obtained by raising or lowering
the work table. The design is just the reverse, in this respect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_279" id="Pg_279">[279]</a></span>
of the machine shown in <a href="#Fig_7_1">Fig. 1</a>, which has a vertical adjustment
for the spindle, and a work table that remains in the same
horizontal plane. The raising or lowering of the table is effected
by shaft <i>E</i>, which rotates large nuts engaging the screws <i>S</i>.
Shaft <i>E</i> is turned either by hand or power.</p>

<p>The main spindle is driven by a cone pulley <i>P</i>, either directly,
or indirectly through the back-gears shown. This arrangement
gives six spindle speeds, and double this number is
obtained by using a two-speed countershaft overhead. The
motion for feeding the spindle longitudinally is transmitted
through a cone of gears, which gives the required changes, to a
pinion meshing with a rack which traverses the spindle. The
large handwheel <i>H</i> and a corresponding wheel on the opposite
side are used for adjusting the spindle rapidly by hand. The
yoke or outboard bearing <i>B</i> for the boring-bars can be clamped
in any position along the bed for supporting the bar as close to
the work as possible.</p>

<p>Horizontal boring machines are built in many other designs,
but they all have the same general arrangement as the machines
illustrated and operate on the same principle, with the exception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_280" id="Pg_280">[280]</a></span>
of special types intended for handling certain classes of
work exclusively. The horizontal boring, drilling and milling
machine is very efficient for certain classes of work because it
enables all the machining operations on some parts to be completed
at one setting. To illustrate, a casting which requires
drilling, boring and milling at different places, can often be
finished without disturbing its position on the platen after it is
clamped in place. Frequently a comparatively small surface
needs to be milled after a part has been bored. If this milling
operation can be performed while the work is set up for boring,
accurate results will be obtained (provided the machine is in
good condition) and the time saved that would otherwise be
required for re-setting the part on another machine. Some
examples of work on which different operations are performed
at the same setting will be referred to later. The horizontal
boring machine also makes it possible to machine duplicate
parts without the use of jigs, which is important, especially on
large work, owing to the cost of jigs.</p>

<a name="Secnum_7_2" id="Secnum_7_2"></a><p><b>Drilling and Boring&mdash;Cutters Used.</b>&mdash;Holes are drilled in a
horizontal machine by simply inserting a drill of required size
either directly in the spindle <i>S</i> (see <a href="#Fig_7_1">Fig. 1</a>), or in a reducing
socket, and then feeding the spindle outward either by hand or
power. When a hole is to be bored, a boring-bar <i>B<sub>1</sub></i> is inserted
in the spindle and the cutter is attached to this bar. The
latter is then fed through the hole as the cutter revolves. The
distinction made by machinists between drilling and boring is as
follows: A hole is said to be drilled when it is formed by sinking
a drill into solid metal, whereas boring means the enlargement
of a drilled or cored hole either by the use of a single boring
tool, a double-ended cutter which operates on both sides of the
hole, or a cutter-head having several tools.</p>

<a name="Fig_7_3" id="Fig_7_3"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><div class="illobox450"><img src="images/289sm.png" alt="Boring-cutters of Different Types" /></div>
<p class="caption750">Fig. 3. Boring-cutters of Different Types</p>
</div>

<p>There are various methods of attaching cutters to boring-bars
and the cutters used vary for different classes of work. A
simple style of cutter which is used widely for boring small holes
is shown at <i>A</i> in <a href="#Fig_7_3">Fig. 3</a>. The cutter <i>c</i> is made from flat stock
and the cutting is done by the front edges <i>e</i> and <i>e<sub>1</sub></i>, which are
beveled in opposite directions. The cutter is held in the bar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_281" id="Pg_281">[281]</a></span>
by a taper wedge <i>w</i> and it is centered by shoulders at <i>s</i>, so that
the diameter of the hole will equal the length across the cutter.
The outer corners at the front should be slightly rounded, as a
sharp corner would be dulled quickly. These cutters are made
in different sizes and also in sets for roughing and finishing.
The roughing cutter bores holes to within about <sup class="enum">1</sup>/<sub class="denom">32</sub> inch of the
finish size and it is then replaced by the finishing cutter. A
cutter having rounded ends, as shown by the detail sketch <i>a</i>, is
sometimes used for light finishing cuts. These rounded ends
form the cutting edges and give a smooth finish.</p>

<p>Another method of holding a flat cutter is shown at <i>B</i>. The
conical end of a screw bears against a conical seat in, the cutter,
thus binding the latter in its slot. The conical seat also centers
the cutter. A very simple and inexpensive form of cutter is
shown at <i>C</i>. This is made from a piece of round steel, and it
is held in the bar by a taper pin which bears against a circular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_282" id="Pg_282">[282]</a></span>
recess in the side of the cutter. This form has the advantage
of only requiring a hole through the boring-bar, whereas it is
necessary to cut a rectangular slot for the flat cutter.</p>

<a name="Fig_7_4" id="Fig_7_4"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><div class="illobox450"><img src="images/290sm.png" alt="Boring with a Flat Double-ended Cutter" /></div>
<p class="caption750">Fig. 4. Boring with a Flat Double-ended Cutter</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#Fig_7_4">Fig. 4</a> shows how a hole is bored by cutters of the type referred
to. The bar rotates as indicated by the arrow <i>a</i> and at
the same time feeds longitudinally as shown by arrow <i>b</i>. The
speed of rotation depends upon the diameter of the hole and
the kind of material being bored, and the feed per revolution
must also be varied to suit conditions. No definite rule can be
given for speed or feed. On some classes of work a long boring-bar
is used, which passes through the hole to be bored and is
steadied at its outer end by the back-rest <i>B</i>, <a href="#Fig_7_1">Figs. 1</a> and <a href="#Fig_7_2">2</a>.
On other work, a short bar is inserted in the spindle having a
cutter at the outer end. An inexpensive method of holding a
cutter at the end of a bar is shown at <i>D</i>, <a href="#Fig_7_3">Fig. 3</a>. The cutter
passes through a slot and is clamped by a bolt as shown. When
it is necessary to bore holes that are &#8220;blind&#8221; or closed at the
bottom, a long boring-bar which passes through the work cannot,
of course, be used.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is necessary to have a cutter mounted at the
extreme end of a bar in order to bore close to a shoulder or the
bottom of a hole. One method of holding a cutter so that it
projects beyond the end of a bar is indicated at <i>E</i>. A screw
similar to the one shown at <i>B</i> is used, and the conical end bears
in a conical hole in the cutter. This hole should be slightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_283" id="Pg_283">[283]</a></span>
offset so that the cutter will be forced back against its seat.
The tool shown at <i>F</i> has adjustable cutters. The inner end of
each cutter is tapering and bears against a conical-headed screw
<i>b</i> which gives the required outward adjustment. The cutters
are held against the central bolt by fillister-head screws <i>f</i> and
they are clamped by the screws <i>c</i>. Boring tools are made in
many different designs and the number and form of the cutters
is varied somewhat for different kinds of work.</p>

<a name="Fig_7_5" id="Fig_7_5"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><div class="illobox450"><img src="images/291sm.png" alt="Cutter-heads for Boring Large Holes" /></div>
<p class="caption750">Fig. 5. Cutter-heads for Boring Large Holes</p>
</div>

<a name="Secnum_7_3" id="Secnum_7_3"></a><p><b>Cutter-heads for Boring Large Holes.</b>&mdash;When large holes are
to be bored, the cutters are usually held in a cast-iron head
which is mounted on the boring-bar. One type of cutter-head
is shown in <a href="#Fig_7_5">Fig. 5</a>. This particular head is double-ended and
carries two cutters <i>c</i>. The cutter-head is bored to fit the bar
closely and it is prevented from turning by a key against which
a set-screw is tightened. By referring to the end view, it will be
seen that each cutter is offset with relation to the center of the
bar, in order to locate the front of the tool on a radial line.
The number of cutters used in a cutter-head varies. By having
several cutters, the work of removing a given amount of metal in
boring is distributed, and holes can be bored more quickly with
a multiple cutter-head, although more power is required to
drive the boring-bar. The boring-bar is also steadied by a
multiple cutter-head, because the tendency of any one cutter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_284" id="Pg_284">[284]</a></span>
to deflect the bar is counteracted by the cutters on the opposite
side.</p>

</div>

<p>A disk-shaped head having four cutters is illustrated in <a href="#Fig_7_6">Fig.
6</a>. The cutters are inserted in slots or grooves in the face of
the disk and they are held by slotted clamping posts. The
shape of these posts is shown by the sectional view. The tool
passes through an elongated slot and it is tightly clamped
against the disk by tightening nut <i>n</i>. This head is also driven
by a key which engages a keyway in the boring-bar.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 7. Cutter-heads equipped with Adjustable Tools</p>
</div>

<p>Two other designs of cutter-heads are shown in <a href="#Fig_7_7">Fig. 7</a>. The
one illustrated at <i>A</i> has three equally spaced cutters which are
held in an inclined position. The cutters are clamped by screws
<i>c</i> and they can be adjusted within certain limits by screws <i>s</i>.
The cutters are placed at an angle so that they will extend beyond
the front of the head, thus permitting the latter to be
moved up close to a shoulder. The cutter-heads shown in
<a href="#Fig_7_5">Figs. 5</a> and <a href="#Fig_7_6">6</a> can also be moved up close to a shoulder if bent
cutters are used as shown in the right-hand view, <a href="#Fig_7_5">Fig. 5</a>. The
idea in bending the cutters is to bring the cutting edges in
advance of the clamping posts so that they will reach a shoulder
before the binding posts strike it. The arrangement of cutter-head
<i>B</i> (<a href="#Fig_7_7">Fig. 7</a>) is clearly shown by the illustration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_285" id="Pg_285">[285]</a></span>Cutter-heads are often provided with two sets of cutters, one
set being used for roughing and the other for finishing. It is a
good plan to make these cutters so that the ends <i>e</i> (<a href="#Fig_7_6">Fig. 6</a>) will
rest against the bar or bottom of the slot, when the cutting edge
is set to the required radius. The cutters can then be easily
set for boring duplicate work. One method of making cutters
in sets is to clamp the annealed stock in the cutter-head and
then turn the ends to the required radius by placing the head
in the lathe. After both sets of cutters have been turned in
this way, they are ground to shape and then hardened.</p>

<a name="Fig_7_8" id="Fig_7_8"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><div class="illobox450"><img src="images/294sm.png" alt="Boring Tools for Roughing and Finishing Cuts" /></div>
<p class="caption750">Fig. 8. Boring Tools for Roughing and Finishing Cuts</p>
</div>

<p>Boring cutters intended for roughing and finishing cuts are
shown in the detail view <a href="#Fig_7_8">Fig. 8</a> at <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, respectively. The
side of the roughing cutter <i>A</i> is ground to a slight angle <i>c</i> to
provide clearance for the cutting edge, and the front has a
backward slope <i>s</i> to give the tool keenness. This tool is a good
form to use for roughing cuts in cast iron. The finishing tool
at <i>B</i> has a broad flat edge <i>e</i> and it is intended for coarse feeds
and light cuts in cast iron. If a round cutting edge is used for
finishing, a comparatively fine feed is required in order to obtain
a smooth surface. The corners of tool <i>B</i> are rounded and they
should be ground to slope inward as shown in the plan view.
The top or ends <i>d</i> of both of these tools are &#8220;backed off&#8221; slightly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_286" id="Pg_286">[286]</a></span>
to provide clearance. This clearance should be just enough to
prevent the surface back of the cutting edge from dragging over
the work. Excessive end clearance not only weakens the cutting
edge, but tends to cause chattering. As a finishing tool
cuts on the upper end instead of on the side, the front should
slope backward as shown in the side view, rather than sidewise
as with a roughing cutter. The angle of the slope should
be somewhat greater for steel than cast iron, unless the steel is
quite hard, thus requiring a strong blunt tool.</p>

<a name="Fig_7_9" id="Fig_7_9"></a>
<div class="figcenter"><div class="illobox450"><img src="images/295sm.png" alt="Cylinder mounted on Horizontal Machine for Boring" /></div>
<p class="caption750">Fig. 9. Cylinder mounted on Horizontal Machine for Boring</p>
</div>

<a name="Secnum_7_4" id="Secnum_7_4"></a><p><b>Cylinder Boring.</b>&mdash;<a href="#Fig_7_9">Fig. 9</a>
illustrates the use of a cutter-head for cylinder boring. After the cylinder casting is set on the
platen of the machine, the boring-bar with the cutter-head
mounted on it is inserted in the spindle. The bar <i>B</i> has a taper
shank and a driving tang similar to a drill shank, which fits a
taper hole in the end of the spindle. The cutter-head <i>C</i> is
fastened to the bar so that it will be in the position shown when
the spindle is shifted to the right, as the feeding movement
(with this particular machine) is to be in the opposite direction.
The casting <i>A</i> should be set central with the bar by adjusting
the work-table vertically and laterally, if necessary, and the
outer support <i>F</i> should be moved close to the work, to make the
bar as rigid as possible.</p>

<p>The cylinder is now ready to be bored. Ordinarily, one or
two roughing cuts and one finishing cut would be sufficient, unless
the rough bore were considerably below the finish diameter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_287" id="Pg_287">[287]</a></span>
As previously explained, the speed and feed must be governed
by the kind of material being bored and the diameter of the
cut. The power and rigidity of the boring machine and the
quality of the steel used for making the cutters also affect
the cutting speed and feed. As the finishing cut is very light, a
tool having a flat cutting edge set parallel to the bar is ordinarily
used when boring cast iron. The coarse feed enables the
cut to be taken in a comparatively short time and the broad-nosed
tool gives a smooth finish if properly ground.</p>

<p>The coarse finishing feed is not always practicable, especially
if the boring machine is in poor condition, owing to the chattering
of the tool, which results in a rough surface. The last or
finishing cut should invariably be a continuous one, for if the
machine is stopped before the cut is completed, there will be a
ridge in the bore at the point where the tool temporarily left off
cutting. This ridge is caused by the cooling and resulting contraction
and shortening of the tool during the time that it is
stationary. For this reason independent drives are desirable
for boring machines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_288" id="Pg_288">[288]</a></span>Facing arms are attached to the bar on either side of the
cylinder for facing the flanges after the boring operation. The
turning tool of a facing arm is fastened to a slide which is fed
outward a short distance each revolution, by a star-wheel that
is caused to turn as it strikes against a stationary pin. By
facing the flanges in this way, they are finished square with the
bore.</p>

<p>When setting a cylinder which is to be bored it should, when
the design will permit, be set true by the outside of the flange,
or what is even better, by the outside of the cylinder itself,
rather than by the rough bore, in order that the walls of the
finished cylinder will have a uniform thickness. The position
of very large cylinders, while they are being bored, is an important
consideration. Such cylinders should be bored in the
position which they will subsequently occupy when assembled.
For example, the cylinder for a large horizontal engine should
be bored while in a horizontal position, as the bore is liable to
spring to a slight oval shape when the cylinder is placed horizontal
after being bored while standing in a vertical position. If,
however, the cylinder is bored while in the position in which it
will be placed in the assembled engine, this trouble is practically
eliminated.</p>

<p>There is a difference of opinion among machinists as to the
proper shape of the cutting point of a boring tool for finishing
cuts, some contending that a wide cutting edge is to be preferred,
while others advocate the use of a comparatively narrow
edge with a reduced feed. It is claimed, that the narrow tool
produces a more perfect bore, as it is not so easily affected by
hard spots in the iron, and it is also pointed out that the minute
ridges left by the narrow tool are an advantage rather than a
disadvantage, as they form pockets for oil and aid in lubricating
the cylinder. It is the modern practice, however, to use a
broad tool and a coarse feed for the light finishing cut, provided
the tool does not chatter.</p>

<p>The type of machine tool used for boring cylinders, and also
the method of procedure is determined largely by the size of
the work and the quantity which is to be machined. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_289" id="Pg_289">[289]</a></span>
turret lathe, as well as horizontal and vertical boring mills, is
used for this work, and in automobile factories or other shops
where a great many cylinders are bored, special machines and
fixtures are often employed.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/297sm.jpg" alt="Boring a Duplex Cylinder on Horizontal Machine" />
<p class="caption750">Fig. 10. Boring a Duplex Cylinder on a Horizontal Machine</p>
</div>

<a name="Secnum_7_5" id="Secnum_7_5"></a><p><b>Boring a Duplex Gasoline Engine Cylinder.</b>&mdash;The method of
holding work on a horizontal boring machine depends on its
shape. A cylinder or other casting having a flat base can be
clamped directly to the platen, but pieces of irregular shape are
usually held in special fixtures. <a href="#Fig_7_10">Fig. 10</a> shows how the cylinder
casting of a gasoline engine is set up for the boring operation.
The casting <i>W</i> is placed in a fixture <i>F</i> which is clamped to the
machine table. One end of the casting rests on the adjustable
screws <i>S</i> and it is clamped by set-screws located in the top and
sides of the fixture. There are two cylinders cast integral and
these are bored by a short stiff bar mounted in the end of the
spindle and having cutters at the outer end. A long bar of
the type which passes through the work and is supported by the
outboard bearing <i>B</i>, could not be used for this work, because
the top of each cylinder is closed.</p>

<p>When one cylinder is finished the other is set in line with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_290" id="Pg_290">[290]</a></span>
spindle by adjusting the work-table laterally. This adjustment
is effected by screw <i>C</i>, and the required center-to-center
distance between the two cylinders can be gaged by the micrometer
dial <i>M</i> on the cross-feed screw, although positive stops
are often used in preference. After the first cylinder is bored,
the dial is set to the zero position by loosening the small knurled
screw shown, and turning the dial around. The feed screw is
then rotated until the dial shows that the required lateral
adjustment is made, which locates the casting for boring the
second cylinder. The end of the casting is also faced true by a
milling cutter. Ordinarily, milling cutters are bolted directly
to the spindle sleeve <i>A</i> on this particular machine, which gives
a rigid support for the cutter and a powerful drive.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 11. Cylinder turned around for Machining Valve Seats</p>
</div>

<p>The next operation is that of boring and milling the opposite
end of the cylinder. This end is turned toward the spindle
(as shown in <a href="#Fig_7_11">Fig. 11</a>) without unclamping the work or fixture,
by simply turning the circular table <i>T</i> half way around. This
table is an attachment which is clamped to the main table for
holding work that must be turned to different positions for
machining the various parts. Its position is easily changed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_291" id="Pg_291">[291]</a></span>
as the work remains fixed with relation to the table, the alignment
between different holes or surfaces is assured, if the table
is turned the right amount. In this case, the casting needs to
be rotated one-half a revolution or 180 degrees, and this is done
by means of angular graduations on the base of the table.
The illustration shows the casting set for boring the inlet and
exhaust valve chambers. The different cutters required for
boring are mounted on one bar as shown, and the casting is
adjusted crosswise to bring each valve chamber in position, by
using the micrometer dial. The single-ended cutter <i>c</i> forms a
shallow circular recess or seat in the raised pad which surrounds
the opening. The cover joint directly back of the cylinders is
finished by milling.</p>

example of boring, in which the circular table is used, is shown
in <a href="#Fig_7_12">Fig. 12</a>. The work <i>W</i> is a casing for the differential gears of
an automobile. It is mounted in a fixture <i>F</i> which is bolted to
the table. The casting has round ends, which are clamped in
V-blocks, thus aligning the work. This fixture has a guide-bushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_292" id="Pg_292">[292]</a></span>
<i>G</i> which is centered with the bar and cutter in order to
properly locate the casting. There is a bearing at each end of
the casing, and two larger ones in the center. These are bored
by flat cutters similar to the style illustrated at <i>A</i> in <a href="#Fig_7_3">Fig. 3</a>.
The cutter for the inner bearings is shown at <i>c</i>.</p>

<p class="caption750">Fig. 13. Facing and Turning Flange of Differential Gear Casing</p>
</div>

<p>After the bearings are bored, the circular table is turned 90
degrees and the work is moved closer to the spindle (as shown
in <a href="#Fig_7_13">Fig. 13</a>) for facing flange <i>F</i> at right angles to the bearings.
Circular flanges of this kind are faced in a horizontal boring
machine by a special facing-arm or head <i>H</i>. For this particular
job this head is clamped directly to the spindle sleeve,
but it can also be clamped to the spindle if necessary. The
turning tool is held in a slotted toolpost, and it is fed radially
for turning the side or face of the flange, by the well-known
star feed at <i>S</i>. When this feed is in operation the bent finger
<i>E</i> is turned downward so that it strikes one of the star wheel
arms for each revolution; this turns the wheel slightly, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_293" id="Pg_293">[293]</a></span>
the movement is transmitted to the tool-block by a feed-screw.
The illustration shows the tool set for turning the outside or
periphery of the flange. This is done by setting the tool to the
proper radius and then feeding the work horizontally by shifting
the work-table along the bed. By referring to <a href="#Fig_7_12">Fig. 12</a> it will be
seen that the facing head does not need to be removed for boring,
as it is attached to the spindle driving quill and does not interfere
with the longitudinal adjustment of the spindle. This
facing head is also used frequently for truing the flanges of
cylinders which are to be bored, and for similar work.</p>

</div>

<p><a href="#Fig_7_14">Fig. 14</a> shows another example of work which requires boring
and milling. This casting is mounted on a fixture which is
bolted to the main table. In this case the circular table is not
necessary, because the work can be finished without swiveling
it around. After the boring is completed the edge <i>E</i> is trued
by the large-face milling cutter <i>M</i> bolted to the spindle sleeve.
The irregular outline of the edge is followed by moving the table
crosswise and the spindle vertically, as required.</p>

in <a href="#Fig_7_15">Fig. 15</a>. The lining <i>L</i> is mounted in two cast-iron ring-shaped
fixtures <i>F</i>. These fixtures are circular in shape and have
flat bases which are bolted to the table of the machine. On the
inside of each fixture, there are four equally spaced wedges <i>W</i>
which fit into grooves as shown in the end view. These wedges
are drawn in against the work by bolts, and they prevent the
lining from rotating when a cut is being taken. This form of
fixture is especially adapted for holding thin bronze linings,
such as are used in pump cylinders, because only a light pressure
against the wedges is required, and thin work can be
held without distorting it. If a very thin lining is being
bored, it is well to loosen the wedges slightly before taking the
finishing cut, so that the work can spring back to its normal
shape.</p>

</div>

<a name="Secnum_7_8" id="Secnum_7_8"></a><p><b>Horizontal Boring Machine of Floor Type.</b>&mdash;The type of
horizontal boring, drilling and milling machine, shown in <a href="#Fig_7_16">Fig. 16</a>,
is intended for boring heavy parts such as the cylinders of large
engines or pumps, the bearings of heavy machine beds and
similar work. This machine can also be used for drilling and
milling, although it is intended primarily for boring, and the
other operations are usually secondary. This design is ordinarily
referred to as the &#8220;floor type,&#8221; because the work-table
is low for accommodating large heavy castings. The spindle <i>S</i>
which drives the boring-bar, and the spindle feeding mechanism,
are carried by a saddle. This saddle is free to move vertically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_296" id="Pg_296">[296]</a></span>
on the face of column <i>C</i> which is mounted on transverse ways
extending across the right-hand end of the main bed. This
construction permits the spindle to move vertically or laterally
(by traversing the column) either for adjusting it to the required
position or for milling operations. The spindle also
has a longitudinal movement for boring. There is an outer
bearing <i>B</i> for supporting the boring-bar, which also has lateral
and vertical adjustments, so that it can be aligned with the
bar.</p>

<p>The work done on a machine of this type is either clamped
directly to the large bed-plate <i>A</i> (which has a number of T-slots
for receiving the heads of the clamping bolts) or, in some cases,
a special fixture may be used or an auxiliary table. Boring
machines of this same general construction are built in many
different sizes. The main spindle of the machine illustrated is
driven by a motor located at the rear of the vertical column
<i>C</i>, the motion being transmitted to the spindle through shafts
and gearing. The casting <i>D</i>, shown in this particular illustration,
is for a steam engine of the horizontal type, and the operation
is that of boring the cylindrical guides or bearings for the
crosshead. These bearings have a diameter of 15<sup class="enum">3</sup>/<sub class="denom">4</sub> inches and
are 37<sup class="enum">3</sup>/<sub class="denom">4</sub> inches long. In boring them, two roughing cuts and one
finishing cut are taken. The end of the casting, which in the
assembled engine bears against the cylinder, is then faced by
means of a regular facing arm.</p>

<p>After removing the boring-bar the table <i>E</i> of the special
fixture on which the casting is mounted is turned one quarter
of a revolution. A large milling cutter 24 inches in diameter is
next mounted on the spindle of the machine, and one side of
the main bearing, as well as the pads for the valve-rod guide-bar
brackets, are milled. The table is then revolved and the opposite
side of the main bearing is milled in the same way, the
table being accurately located in the different positions by an
index plunger <i>F</i> which engages holes on the under side. The
spindle is now moved upward to allow the table to be turned so
as to locate the bearing end of the frame next to the headstock
of the machine. The milling cutter is then used to machine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_297" id="Pg_297">[297]</a></span>
the inside and top surfaces of the main bearing. By turning the
fixture and not changing the position of the casting after it is
bolted into place, the various surfaces are machined in the correct
relation to one another without difficulty. This is a good
example of the work done on horizontal boring machines of the
floor type.</p>
